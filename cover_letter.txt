Dear Editors,

I write to submit a manuscript for publication as a scientific article titled
*Machine learning of prostate MRI: towards improved non-invasive prostate cancer
characterization*
and written by
Jussi Toivonen, Ileana Montoya Perez, Parisa Movahedi, Harri Merisaari, Marko
Pesola, Pekka Taimen, Peter J. Boström, Jonne Pohjankukka, Aida Kiviniemi,
Tapio Pahikkala, Hannu J. Aronen, and Ivan Jambor.

In this study, we develop and validate a machine learning classifier system for
prediction of a prostate cancer risk factor (Gleason score) using various
texture features of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging data (T₂w, DWI,
T₂) from one hundred tumors.

In particular, the process simultaneously includes a very large number of
features with different image types, texture extraction methods, and extraction
parameters, in order to find optimal feature combinations. We utilize a machine
learning technique that tolerates large dimensionality and class imbalance,
while performing implicit feature selection.

Our method successfully found models with good prediction performance, while
also finding out which image types and texture extraction methods worked well
together.

Compared to previously published work on prostate cancer characterization, we
include a large number of texture extractors with some new ones, while
utilizing a novel approach to classifier design.


Yours sincerely,
Jussi Toivonen
