abstract = {In recent years, texture analysis of medical images has become increasingly popular in studies investigating diagnosis, classification and treatment response assessment of cancerous disease. Despite numerous applications in oncology and medical imaging in general, there is no consensus regarding texture analysis workflow, or reporting of parameter settings crucial for replication of results. The aim of this study was to assess how sensitive Haralick texture features of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) MR images are to changes in five parameters related to image acquisition and pre- processing: noise, resolution, how the ADC map is constructed, the choice of quantization method, and the number of gray levels in the quantized image. We found that noise, resolution, choice of quantization method and the number of gray levels in the quantized images had a significant influence on most texture features, and that the effect size varied between different features. Different methods for constructing the ADC maps did not have an impact on any texture feature. Based on our results, we recommend using images with similar resolutions and noise levels, using one quantization method, and the same number of gray levels in all quantized images, to make meaningful comparisons of texture feature results between different subjects.},

A new set of TX . 903-86-C-0182. IEEE Log Number 8933763. {\_}{\_} 489 rotation invariant features are introduced. They are the magnitudes of a set of orthogonal complex moments of the image known as Zernike moments. Scale and translation invariance are obtained by first nor-malizing the image with respect to these parameters using its regular geometrical moments. A systematic reconstruction-based method for deciding the highest order of Zernike moments required in a classifi-cation problem is developed. The " quality " of the reconstructed image is examined through its comparison to the original one. More moments are included until the reconstructed image from them is close enough to the original picture. The orthogonality property of the Zernike mo-ments which simplifies the process of image reconstruction makes the suggested feature selection approach practical. Furthermore, features of each order can also be weighted according to their contribution (their image representation ability) to the reconstruction process. The method is tested using clean and noisy images from a 26-class character data set and a 4-class lake data set. The superiority of Zernike moment fea-tures over regular moments and moment invariants is experimentally verified.

abstract = {In mammography diagnosis systems, high False Negative Rate (FNR) has always been a significant problem since a false negative answer may lead to a patient's death. This paper is directed towards the development of a novel Computer-aided Diagnosis (CADx) system for the diagnosis of breast masses. It aims at intensifying the performance of CADx algorithms as well as reducing the FNR by utilizing Zernike moments as descriptors of shape and margin characteristics. The input Regions of Interest (ROIs) are segmented manually and further subjected to a number of preprocessing stages. The outcomes of preprocessing stage are two processed images containing co-scaled translated masses. Besides, one of these images represents the shape characteristics of the mass, while the other describes the margin characteristics. Two groups of Zernike moments have been extracted from the preprocessed images and applied to the feature selection stage. Each group includes 32 moments with different orders and iterations. Considering the performance of the overall CADx system, the most effective moments have been chosen and applied to a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, employing both generic Back Propagation (BP) and Opposition-based Learning (OBL) algorithms. The Receiver Operational Characteristics (ROC) curve and the performance of resulting CADx systems are analyzed for each group of features. The designed systems yield Az=0.976, representing fair sensitivity, and Az=0.975 demonstrating fair specificity. The best achieved FNR and FPR are 0.0{\%} and 5.5{\%}, respectively. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@phdthesis{Laws1980,
abstract = {The problem of image texture analysis is introduced, and existing approaches are surveyed. An empirical evaluation method is applied to two texture measurement systems, co-occurrence statistics and augmented correlation statistics. A spatial-statistical class of texture measures is then defined and evaluated. It leads to a simple class of texture energy transforms, which perform better than any of the preceding methods. These transforms are very fast, and can be made invariant to changes in luminance, contrast, and rotation without histogram equalization or other preprocessing. Texture energy is measured by filtering with small masks, typically 5x5, then with a moving-window average of the absolute image values. This method, similar to human visual processing, is appropriate for textures with short coherence length or correlation distance. The filter masks are integer-valued and separable, and can be implemented with one-dimensional or 3x3 convolutions. The averaging operation is also very fast, with computing time independent of window size. Texture energy planes may be linearly combined to form a smaller number of discriminant planes. These principal component planes seem to represent natural texture dimensions, and to be more reliable texture measures than the texture energy planes. Texture segmentation or classification may be accomplished using either texture energy or principal component planes as input. This study classified 15x15 blocks of eight natural textures. Accuracies of 72{\%} were achieved with co- occurrence statistics, 65{\%} with augmented correlation statistics, and 94{\%} with texture energy statistics.},

abstract = {A magnetic resonance imaging method is presented for quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter, reflecting the structural differences between these two types of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.},

abstract = {Screening and detection of prostate cancer (CaP) currently lacks an image-based protocol which is reflected in the high false negative rates currently associated with blinded sextant biopsies. Multi-protocol magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers high resolution functional and structural data about internal body structures (such as the prostate). In this paper we present a novel comprehensive computer-aided scheme for CaP detection from high resolution in vivo multi-protocol MRI by integrating functional and structural information obtained via dynamic-contrast enhanced (DCE) and T2-weighted (T2-w) MRI, respectively. Our scheme is fully-automated and comprises (a) prostate segmentation, (b) multimodal image registration, and (c) data representation and multi-classifier modules for information fusion. Following prostate boundary segmentation via an improved active shape model, the DCE/T2-w protocols and the T2-w/ex vivo histological prostatectomy specimens are brought into alignment via a deformable, multi-attribute registration scheme. T2-w/histology alignment allows for the mapping of true CaP extent onto the in vivo MRI, which is used for training and evaluation of a multi-protocol MRI CaP classifier. The meta-classifier used is a random forest constructed by bagging multiple decision tree classifiers, each trained individually on T2-w structural, textural and DCE functional attributes. 3-fold classifier cross validation was performed using a set of 18 images derived from 6 patient datasets on a per-pixel basis. Our results show that the results of CaP detection obtained from integration of T2-w structural textural data and DCE functional data (area under the ROC curve of 0.815) significantly outperforms detection based on either of the individual modalities (0.704 (T2-w) and 0.682 (DCE)). It was also found that a meta-classifier trained directly on integrated T2-w and DCE data (data-level integration) significantly outperformed a decision-level meta-classifier, constructed by combining the classifier outputs from the individual T2-w and DCE channels.},

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.},

abstract = {Image intensity standardization is a postprocessing method designed for correcting acquisition-to-acquisition signal intensity variations (nonstandardness) inherent in magnetic resonance (MR) images. Inhomogeneity correction is a process used to suppress the low frequency background nonuniformities (inhomogeneities) of the image domain that exist in MR images. Both these procedures have important implications in MR image analysis. The effects of these postprocessing operations on improvement of image quality in isolation has been well documented. However, the combined effects of these two processes on MR images and how the processes influence each other have not been studied thus far. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of inhomogeneity correction followed by standardization and vice-versa on MR images in order to determine the best sequence to follow for enhancing image quality. We conducted experiments on several clinical and phantom data sets (nearly 4000 three-dimensional MR images were analyzed) corresponding to four different MRI protocols. Different levels of artificial nonstandardness, and different models and levels of artificial background inhomogeneity were used in these experiments. Our results indicate that improved standardization can be achieved by preceding it with inhomogeneity correction. There is no statistically significant difference in image quality obtained between the results of standardization followed by correction and that of correction followed by standardization from the perspective of inhomogeneity correction. The correction operation is found to bias the effect of standardization. We demonstrate this bias both qualitatively and quantitatively by using two different methods of inhomogeneity correction. We also show that this bias in standardization is independent of the specific inhomogeneity correction method used. The effect of this bias due to correction was also seen in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) images, which are naturally endowed with the standardness property. Standardization, on the other hand, does not seem to influence the correction operation. It is also found that longer sequences of repeated correction and standardization operations do not considerably improve image quality. These results were found to hold for the clinical and the phantom data sets, for different MRI protocols, for different levels of artificial nonstandardness, for different models and levels of artificial inhomogeneity, for different correction methods, and for images that were endowed with inherent standardness as well as for those that were standardized by using the intensity standardization method. Overall, we conclude that inhomogeneity correction followed by intensity standardization is the best sequence to follow from the perspective of both image quality and computational efficiency.},

In this study, we present a novel automatic technique, called STI for STandardization of Intensities , which not only shares the simplicity and robustness of histogram-matching techniques, but also incorporates tissue spatial intensity information. STI uses joint intensity histograms to determine intensity correspondence in each tissue between the input and standard images. We compared STI to an existing histogram-matching technique on two multicentric datasets, Pilot E-ADNI and ADNI, by measuring the intensity error with respect to the standard image after performing nonlinear registration. The Pilot E-ADNI dataset consisted in 3 subjects each scanned in 7 different sites. The ADNI dataset consisted in 795 subjects scanned in more than 50 different sites. STI was superior to the histogram-matching technique, showing significantly better intensity matching for the brain white matter with respect to the standard image.},

We present machine learning-based automatic classification of prostate cancer aggressiveness by combining apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2-w) MRI-based texture features. Our approach achieved reasonably accurate classification of Gleason scores (GS) 6(3 + 3) vs. ≥7 and 7(3 + 4) vs. 7(4 + 3) despite the presence of highly unbalanced samples by using two different sample augmentation techniques followed by feature selection-based classification. Our method distinguished between GS 6(3 + 3) and ≥7 cancers with 93{\%} accuracy for cancers occurring in both peripheral (PZ) and transition (TZ) zones and 92{\%} for cancers occurring in the PZ alone. Our approach distinguished the GS 7(3 + 4) from GS 7(4 + 3) with 92{\%} accuracy for cancers occurring in both the PZ and TZ and with 93{\%} for cancers occurring in the PZ alone. In comparison, a classifier using only the ADC mean achieved a top accuracy of 58{\%} for distinguishing GS 6(3 + 3) vs. GS ≥7 for cancers occurring in PZ and TZ and 63{\%} for cancers occurring in PZ alone. The same classifier achieved an accuracy of 59{\%} for distinguishing GS 7(3 + 4) from GS 7(4 + 3) occurring in the PZ and TZ and 60{\%} for cancers occurring in PZ alone. Separate analysis of the cancers occurring in TZ alone was not performed owing to the limited number of samples.

However, recent controversies generated by the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening followed by random biopsy have encouraged the development of new imaging methods for prostate cancer. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has emerged as the imaging method best able to detect clinically significant prostate cancers and to guide biopsies. Here, the authors explain what mpMRI is and how it is used clinically, especially with regard to high-risk populations, and we discuss the impact of mpMRI on treatment decisions for men with prostate cancer.

abstract = {Texture based image analysis techniques have been widely employed in the interpretation of earth cover images obtained using remote sensing techniques, seismic trace images, medical images and in query by content in large image data bases. The development in multi-resolution analysis such as wavelet transform leads to the development of adequate tools to characterize different scales of textures effectively. But, the wavelet transform lacks in its ability to decompose input image into multiple orientations and this limits their application to rotation invariant image analysis. This paper presents a new approach for rotation invariant texture classification using Gabor wavelets. Gabor wavelets are the mathematical model of visual cortical cells of mammalian brain and using this, an image can be decomposed into multiple scales and multiple orientations. The Gabor function has been recognized as a very useful tool in texture analysis, due to its optimal localization properties in both spatial and frequency domain and found widespread use in computer vision. Texture features are found by calculating the mean and variance of the Gabor filtered image. Rotation normalization is achieved by the circular shift of the feature elements, so that all images have the same dominant direction. The texture similarity measurement of the query image and the target image in the database is computed by minimum distance criterion. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objectives: To assess the changes in the concordance rate of prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy (RP) Gleason score (GS) over 15 years. Methods: We reviewed 1670 consecutive patients who underwent RP between 1992 and 2006. We excluded patients who underwent neoadjuvant hormone therapy or salvage RP, or who had incomplete data. Patients who had RP during 1992 through 1996, 1997 through 2001, and 2002 through 2006 were assigned to groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All clinical and pathological data were collected retrospectively. We defined overgrading as a biopsy GS higher than the RP Gleason score. Undergrading was a biopsy GS less than the RP Gleason score. The GS concordance between biopsy and RP was evaluated by kappa coefficient. Results: A total of 1363 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Biopsy and RP Gleason score categories correlated exactly in 937 (69{\%}) men. Gleason undergrading occurred in 361 (26{\%}) men and overgrading in 65 (5{\%}). The exact correlation of GS between biopsy and RP was 58{\%}, 66{\%}, and 75{\%} in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The most common discordant finding was undergrading of the biopsy specimen. The number of cases with exact correlation was highest in GS 7 (78{\%}). Undergrading was more in GS 6 or less (35{\%}) and overgrading was more in the GS 8 through 10 (35{\%}) category. Conclusions: This large, single institutional study confirms increasing concordance of Gleason scores in prostate needle biopsies and surgical specimens. This is reassuring for patients assessing various treatment options for prostate cancer. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most commonly occurring cancer among men in the United States, second only to skin cancer. Currently, the only definitive method to ascertain the presence of prostatic cancer is by trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) directed biopsy. Owing to the poor image quality of ultrasound, the accuracy of TRUS is only 20{\%}-25{\%}. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to have a higher accuracy of prostate cancer detection compared to ultrasound. Consequently, several researchers have been exploring the use of high resolution MRI in performing prostate biopsies. Visual detection of prostate cancer, however, continues to be difficult owing to its apparent lack of shape, and the fact that several malignant and benign structures have overlapping intensity and texture characteristics. In this paper, we present a fully automated computer-aided detection (CAD) system for detecting prostatic adenocarcinoma from 4 Tesla ex vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imagery of the prostate. After the acquired MR images have been corrected for background inhomogeneity and nonstandardness, novel three-dimensional (3-D) texture features are extracted from the 3-D MRI scene. A Bayesian classifier then assigns each image voxel a "likelihood" of malignancy for each feature independently. The "likelihood" images generated in this fashion are then combined using an optimally weighted feature combination scheme. Quantitative evaluation was performed by comparing the CAD results with the manually ascertained ground truth for the tumor on the MRI. The tumor labels on the MR slices were determined manually by an expert by visually registering the MR slices with the corresponding regions on the histology slices. We evaluated our CAD system on a total of 33 two-dimensional (2-D) MR slices from five different 3-D MR prostate studies. Five slices from two different glands were used for training. Our feature combination scheme was found to outperform the individual texture features, and also other popularly used feature combination methods, including AdaBoost, ensemble averaging, and majority voting. Further, in several instances our CAD system performed better than the experts in terms of accuracy, the expert segmentations being determined solely from visual inspection of the MRI data. In addition, the intrasystem variability (changes in CAD accuracy with changes in values of system parameters) was significantly lower than the corresponding intraobserver and interobserver variability. CAD performance was found to be very similar for different training sets. Future work will focus on extending the methodology to guide high-resolution MRI-assisted in vivo prostate biopsies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between prostate cancer aggressiveness and histogram-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) parameters obtained from whole-lesion assessment of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the prostate and to determine which ADC metric may help best differentiate low-grade from intermediate- or high-grade prostate cancer lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective HIPAA-compliant study of 131 men (median age, 60 years) who underwent diffusion-weighted MR imaging before prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Clinically significant tumors (tumor volume {\textgreater} 0.5 mL) were identified at whole-mount step-section histopathologic examination, and Gleason scores of the tumors were recorded. A volume of interest was drawn around each significant tumor on ADC maps. The mean, median, and 10th and 25th percentile ADCs were determined from the whole-lesion histogram and correlated with the Gleason score by using the Spearman correlation coefficient (rho). The ability of each parameter to help differentiate tumors with a Gleason score of 6 from those with a Gleason score of at least 7 was assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az). RESULTS: In total, 116 clinically significant lesions (89 in the peripheral zone, 27 in the transition zone) were identified in 85 of the 131 patients (65{\%}). Forty-six patients did not have a clinically significant lesion. For mean ADC, median ADC, 10th percentile ADC, and 25th percentile ADC, the Spearman rho values for correlation with Gleason score were -0.31, -0.30, -0.36, and -0.35, respectively, whereas the Az values for differentiating lesions with a Gleason score of 6 from those with a Gleason score of at least 7 were 0.704, 0.692, 0.758, and 0.723, respectively. The Az of 10th percentile ADC was significantly higher than that of the mean ADC for all lesions and peripheral zone lesions (P = .0001). CONCLUSION: When whole-lesion histograms were used to derive ADC parameters, 10th percentile ADC correlated with Gleason score better than did other ADC parameters, suggesting that 10th percentile ADC may prove to be optimal for differentiating low-grade from intermediate- or high-grade prostate cancer with diffusion-weighted MR imaging.},

abstract = {Purpose: An update is provided of the Gleason grading system, which has evolved significantly since its initial description. Materials and Methods: A search was performed using the MEDLINE?? database and referenced lists of relevant studies to obtain articles concerning changes to the Gleason grading system. Results: Since the introduction of the Gleason grading system more than 40 years ago many aspects of prostate cancer have changed, including prostate specific antigen testing, transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy with greater sampling, immunohistochemistry for basal cells that changed the classification of prostate cancer and new prostate cancer variants. The system was updated at a 2005 consensus conference of international experts in urological pathology, under the auspices of the International Society of Urological Pathology. Gleason score 2-4 should rarely if ever be diagnosed on needle biopsy, certain patterns (ie poorly formed glands) originally considered Gleason pattern 3 are now considered Gleason pattern 4 and all cribriform cancer should be graded pattern 4. The grading of variants and subtypes of acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate, including cancer with vacuoles, foamy gland carcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma, pseudohyperplastic carcinoma and small cell carcinoma have also been modified. Other recent issues include reporting secondary patterns of lower and higher grades when present to a limited extent, and commenting on tertiary grade patterns which differ depending on whether the specimen is from needle biopsy or radical prostatectomy. Whereas there is little debate on the definition of tertiary pattern on needle biopsy, this issue is controversial in radical prostatectomy specimens. Although tertiary Gleason patterns are typically added to pathology reports, they are routinely omitted in practice since there is no simple way to incorporate them in predictive nomograms/tables, research studies and patient counseling. Thus, a modified radical prostatectomy Gleason scoring system was recently proposed to incorporate tertiary Gleason patterns in an intuitive fashion. For needle biopsy with different cores showing different grades, the current recommendation is to report the grades of each core separately, whereby the highest grade tumor is selected as the grade of the entire case to determine treatment, regardless of the percent involvement. After the 2005 consensus conference several studies confirmed the superiority of the modified Gleason system as well as its impact on urological practice. Conclusions: It is remarkable that nearly 40 years after its inception the Gleason grading system remains one of the most powerful prognostic factors for prostate cancer. This system has remained timely because of gradual adaptations by urological pathologists to accommodate the changing practice of medicine. ?? 2010 American Urological Association.},

abstract = {Conventional Gabor representation and its extracted features often yield a fairly poor performance in retrieving the rotated and scaled versions of the texture image under query. To address this issue, existing methods exploit multiple stages of transformations for making rotation and/or scaling being invariant at the expense of high computational complexity and degraded retrieval performance. The latter is mainly due to the lost of image details after multiple transformations. In this paper, a rotation-invariant and a scale-invariant Gabor representations are proposed, where each representation only requires few summations on the conventional Gabor filter impulse responses. The optimum setting of the orientation parameter and scale parameter is experimentally determined over the Brodatz and MPEG-7 texture databases. Features are then extracted from these new representations for conducting rotation-invariant or scale-invariant texture image retrieval. Since the dimension of the new feature space is much reduced, this leads to a much smaller metadata storage space and faster on-line computation on the similarity measurement. Simulation results clearly show that our proposed invariant Gabor representations and their extracted invariant features significantly outperform the conventional Gabor representation approach for rotation-invariant and scale-invariant texture image retrieval. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Two major classification schemes are currently used: the modified American system and the TNM system [primary tumor (T), regional lymph node (N), and metastases (M)]. Both systems stratify patients according to the method of tumor detection, separating nonpalpable "incidental" prostate cancers detected during transurethral resection for clinically benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and palpable cancers detected by digital rectal examination. These staging systems also recognize nonpalpable tumors detected by an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level or an abnormal transrectal ultrasound image. Current staging is limited by a significant level of clinical understaging (up to 59{\%}, in our experience) and overstaging (up to 5{\%}) according to comparison with pathologic examination of resected specimens. Proposed improvements in staging include preoperative systematic sextant biopsies to assess tumor volume, volume-based prognostic index, and a multiple prognostic index. In this report, we evaluate the current aspects of clinical and pathologic staging of prostate cancer with emphasis on the early stages in which there is the greatest chance of cure.},

Different approaches to texture characterization can be considered. In this work texture is analyzed through second order statistical measurements based on the Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix proposed by Haralick. By this method is possible to compute, among others, 5 features which are intended to describe texture: Contrast, Homogeneity, Dissimilarity, Energy and Entropy. The aim of this paper is to analyze the dependency of the features with the displacement considered for their computation and explore the possibility of features invariant under changes of the distance between the sample and observation position.},

Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) is based on the fact that receiver sensitivity generally has an encoding effect complementary to Fourier preparation by linear field gradients. Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging. With an array of five coils double-oblique heart images were obtained in one-third of conventional scan time. Magn Reson Med 42:952-962, 1999.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To investigate whether apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) derived from diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 3 T correlate with the clinical risk of prostate cancer in patients with tumors that are visible on MR images, with MR imaging/transrectal ultrasonography (US) fusion-guided biopsy as a reference. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-eight consecutive patients (median age, 60 years; median serum prostate-specific antigen value, 6.3 ng/mL) who underwent DW imaging during 3-T MR imaging with an endorectal coil were included in this retrospective institutional review board-approved study, and informed consent was obtained from each patient. Patients underwent targeted MR imaging/transrectal US fusion-guided prostate biopsy. Mean ADCs of cancerous target tumors were correlated with Gleason and D'Amico clinical risk scores. The true risk group rate and predictive value of the mean ADC for classifying a tumor by its D'Amico clinical risk score was determined by using linear discriminant and receiver operating characteristic analyses. RESULTS A significant negative correlation was found between mean ADCs of tumors in the peripheral zone and their Gleason scores (P = .003; Spearman $\rho$ = -0.60) and D'Amico clinical risk scores (P {\textless} .0001; Spearman $\rho$ = -0.69). ADC was found to distinguish tumors in the peripheral zone with intermediate to high clinical risk from those with low clinical risk with a correct classification rate of 0.73. CONCLUSION There is a significant negative correlation between ADCs and Gleason and D'Amico clinical risk scores. ADCs may therefore be useful in predicting the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.

abstract = {In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.},

abstract = {A promising approach to prostate cancer diagnosis is multi-parametric MRI. One of the key modalities used in multi-parametric MRI is diffusion weighted MRI. Using multiple diffusion weighted MR acquisitions taken with different magnetic gradient strengths, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is calculated and can be used to identify tumors in the prostate. Current algorithms used to calculate ADC assume a parametric measurement model, but this assumption is not true due to the presence of additional phenomena during the acquisition process. A novel Non-parametric Estimated ADC (NEstA) algorithm is proposed which uses a Monte Carlo strategy to learn the inherent measurement distribution model based on the underlying statistical behavior of the DWI measurements to estimate the ADC values. The proposed algorithm is compared to the results of the commonly used least-squares (LS) estimation algorithm for computing ADC values. Nine test patient cases with visible tumors in the prostate gland were processed using both algorithms and compared visually. It was found that NEstA produced ADC data with reduced artifacts while preserving structure. Quantitatively, Fisher's criterion measuring the separability of the healthy prostate and tumor tissues was computed for the nine patient cases, comparing the NEstA and LS methods. It was found that Fisher's criterion increased with the NEstA method, meaning the separation of classes was more pronounced.},

abstract = {In addition to the diffusion coefficient, fitting the intravoxel incoherent motion model to multiple b-value diffusion-weighted MR data gives pseudo-diffusion measures associated with rapid signal attenuation at low b-values that are of use in the assessment of a number of pathologies. When summary measures are required, such as the average parameter for a region of interest, least-squares based methods give adequate estimation accuracy. However, using least-squares methods for pixel-wise fitting typically gives noisy estimates, especially for the pseudo-diffusion parameters, which limits the applicability of the approach for assessing spatial features and heterogeneity. In this article, a Bayesian approach using a shrinkage prior model is proposed and is shown to substantially reduce estimation uncertainty so that spatial features in the parameters maps are more clearly apparent. The Bayesian approach has no user-defined parameters, so measures of parameter variation (heterogeneity) over regions of interest are determined by the data alone, whereas it is shown that for the least-squares estimates, measures of variation are essentially determined by user-defined constraints on the parameters. Use of a Bayesian shrinkage prior approach is, therefore, recommended for intravoxel incoherent motion modeling.},

Critical to the performance of a quantitative imaging biomarker in preclinical or clinical settings are three primary metrology areas of interest: measurement linearity and bias, repeatability, and the ability to consistently reproduce equivalent results when conditions change, as would be expected in any clinical trial. Unfortunately, performance studies to date differ greatly in designs, analysis method, and metrics used to assess a quantitative imaging biomarker for clinical use. It is therefore difficult or not possible to integrate results from different studies or to use reported results to design studies. The Radiological Society of North America and the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance with technical, radiological, and statistical experts developed a set of technical performance analysis methods, metrics, and study designs that provide terminology, metrics, and methods consistent with widely accepted metrological standards.

abstract = {Detailed measurements of water diffusion within the prostate over an extended b-factor range were performed to assess whether the standard assumption of monoexponential signal decay is appropriate in this organ. From nine men undergoing prostate MR staging examinations at 1.5 T, a single 10-mm-thick axial slice was scanned with a line scan diffusion imaging sequence in which 14 equally spaced b factors from 5 to 3500 s/mm2 were sampled along three orthogonal diffusion sensitization directions in 6 min. Due to the combination of long scan time and limited volume coverage associated with the multi-b-factor, multidirectional sampling, the slice was chosen online from the available T2-weighted axial images with the specific goal of enabling the sampling of presumed noncancerous regions of interest (ROIs) within the central gland (CG) and peripheral zone (PZ). Histology from prescan biopsy (n=9) and postsurgical resection (n=4) was subsequently employed to help confirm that the ROIs sampled were noncancerous. The CG ROIs were characterized from the T2-weighted images as primarily mixtures of glandular and stromal benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is prevalent in this population. The water signal decays with b factor from all ROIs were clearly non-monoexponential and better served with bi- vs. monoexponential fits, as tested using ??2-based F test analyses. Fits to biexponential decay functions yielded intersubject fast diffusion component fractions in the order of 0.73??0.08 for both CG and PZ ROIs, fast diffusion coefficients of 2.68??0.39 and 2.52??0.38 ??m2/ms and slow diffusion coefficients of 0.44??0.16 and 0.23??0.16 um2/ms for CG and PZ ROIs, respectively. The difference between the slow diffusion coefficients within CG and PZ was statistically significant as assessed with a Mann-Whitney nonparametric test (P{\textless}.05). We conclude that a monoexponential model for water diffusion decay in prostate tissue is inadequate when a large range of b factors is sampled and that biexponential analyses are better suited for characterizing prostate diffusion decay curves. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this work, two different approaches are proposed for region of interest (ROI) segmentation using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images. The two methods aim to extract informative features that are able to characterize suspicious regions in the TRUS images. Both proposed methods are based on multi-resolution analysis that is characterized by its high localization in both the frequency and the spatial domains. Being highly localized in both domains, the proposed methods are expected to accurately identify the suspicious ROIs. On one hand, the first method depends on a Gabor filter that captures the high frequency changes in the image regions. On the other hand, the second method depends on classifying the wavelet coefficients of the image. It is shown in this paper that both methods reveal details in the ROIs which correlate with their pathological representations. It was found that there is a good match between the regions identified using the two methods, a result that supports the ability of each of the proposed methods to mimic the radiologist's decision in identifying suspicious regions. Studying two ROI segmentation methods is important since the only available dataset is the radiologist's suspicious regions, and there is a need to support the results obtained by either one of the proposed methods. This work is mainly a preliminary proof of concept study that will ultimately be expanded to a larger scale study whose aim will be introducing an assisting tool to help the radiologist identify the suspicious regions.},

abstract = {We explore the problem of classifying images by the object categories they contain in the case of a large number of object categories. To this end we combine three ingredients: (i) shape and appearance representations that support spatial pyramid matching over a region of interest. This generalizes the representation of Lazebnik et al [16] from an image to a region of interest (ROI), and from appearance (visual words) alone to appearance and local shape (edge distributions). (ii) automatic selection of the regions of interest in training. This provides a method of inhibiting background clutter and adding invariance to the object instance's position, and (iii) the use of random forests (and random ferns) as a multi-way classifier. The advantage of such classifiers (over multi-way SVM for example) is the ease of training and testing. Results are reported for classification of the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 data sets. We compare the performance of the random forest/ferns classifier with a benchmark multi-way SVM classifier. It is shown that selecting the ROI adds about 5{\%} to the performance and, together with the other improvements, the result is about a 10{\%} improvement over the state of the art for Caltech-256.},

The 95{\%} limits of agreement, estimated by mean difference +/- 1.96 standard deviation of the differences, provide an interval within which 95{\%} of differences between measurements by the two methods are expected to lie. We describe how graphical methods can be used to investigate the assumptions of the method and we also give confidence intervals. We extend the basic approach to data where there is a relationship between difference and magnitude, both with a simple logarithmic transformation approach and a new, more general, regression approach. We discuss the importance of the repeatability of each method separately and compare an estimate of this to the limits of agreement. We extend the limits of agreement approach to data with repeated measurements, proposing new estimates for equal numbers of replicates by each method on each subject, for unequal numbers of replicates, and for replicated data collected in pairs, where the underlying value of the quantity being measured is changing. Finally, we describe a nonparametric approach to comparing methods.},

abstract = {Purpose To investigate whether tumor volume derived from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (VolumeADC) and tumor mean ADC value (ADCmean) are independent predictors of prostate tumor Gleason score (GS). Materials and Methods Tumor volume and GS were recorded from whole-mount histopathology for 131 men (median age, 60) who underwent endorectal diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging for local staging of prostate cancer before prostatectomy. VolumeADC and ADCmean were derived from ADC maps and correlated with histopathologic tumor volume and GS. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate prediction of tumor aggressiveness. Areas under receiver-operating-characteristics curves (AUCs) were calculated to evaluate the performance of VolumeADC and ADCmean in discriminating tumors of GS 6 and GS ≥7. Results Histopathology identified 116 tumor foci {\textgreater}0.5 mL. VolumeADC correlated significantly with histopathologic tumor volume ($\rho$=0.683). The correlation increased with increasing GS ($\rho$=0.453 for GS 6 tumors; $\rho$=0.643 for GS 7 tumors; $\rho$=0.980 for GS≥8 tumors). Both VolumeADC ($\rho$=0.286) and ADCmean ($\rho$=-0.309) correlated with GS. At univariate analysis, both VolumeADC (p=0.0325) and ADCmean (p=0.0033) could differentiate GS=6 from GS≥7 tumor foci. However, at multivariate analysis, only ADCmean (p=0.0156) was a significant predictor of tumor aggressiveness (i.e., GS 6 vs. GS ≥7). For differentiating GS 6 from GS≤7 tumors, AUCs were 0.644 and 0.704 for VolumeADC and ADCmean, respectively, and 0.749 for both parameters combined. Conclusion In patients with prostate cancer, ADCmean is an independent predictor of tumor aggressiveness, but VolumeADC is not. The latter parameter adds little to the ADCmean in predicting tumor Gleason score.},

abstract = {Our goal in this paper is to show that many of the tools of signal processing, adapted Fourier and wavelet analysis can be naturally lifted to the setting of digital data clouds, graphs, and manifolds. We use diffusion as a smoothing and scaling tool to enable coarse graining and multiscale analysis. Given a diffusion operator T on a manifold or a graph, with large powers of low rank, we present a general multiresolution construction for efficiently computing, representing and compressing Tt. This allows a direct multiscale computation, to high precision, of functions of the operator, notably the associated Green's function, in compressed form, and their fast application. Classes of operators for which these computations are fast include certain diffusion-like operators, in any dimension, on manifolds, graphs, and in non-homogeneous media. We use ideas related to the Fast Multipole Methods and to the wavelet analysis of Calder{\'{o}}n-Zygmund and pseudo-differential operators, to numerically enforce the emergence of a natural hierarchical coarse graining of a manifold, graph or data set. For example for a body of text documents the construction leads to a directory structure at different levels of generalization. The dyadic powers of an operator can be used to induce a multiresolution analysis, as in classical Littlewood-Paley and wavelet theory: we construct, with efficient and stable algorithms, bases of orthonormal scaling functions and wavelets associated to this multiresolution analysis, together with the corresponding downsampling operators, and use them to compress the corresponding powers of the operator. While most of our discussion deals with symmetric operators and relates to localization to spectral bands, the symmetry of the operators and their spectral theory need not be considered, as the main assumption is reduction of the numerical ranks as we take powers of the operator. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Even though 1 in 6 men in the US, in their lifetime are expected to be diagnosed with prostate cancer (CaP), only 1 in 37 is expected to die on account of it. Consequently, among many men diagnosed with CaP, there has been a recent trend to resort to active surveillance (wait and watch) if diagnosed with a lower Gleason score on biopsy, as opposed to seeking immediate treatment. Some researchers have recently identified imaging markers for low and high grade CaP on multi-parametric (MP) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (such as T2 weighted MR imaging (T2w MRI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS)). In this paper, we present a novel computerized decision support system (DSS), called Semi Supervised Multi Kernel Graph Embedding (SeSMiK-GE), that quantitatively combines structural, and metabolic imaging data for distinguishing (a) benign versus cancerous, and (b) high- versus low-Gleason grade CaP regions from in vivo MP-MRI. A total of 29 1.5. Tesla endorectal pre-operative in vivo MP MRI (T2w MRI, MRS) studies from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were considered in this study. Ground truth for evaluation of the SeSMiK-GE classifier was obtained via annotation of disease extent on the pre-operative imaging by visually correlating the MRI to the ex vivo whole mount histologic specimens. The SeSMiK-GE framework comprises of three main modules: (1) multi-kernel learning, (2) semi-supervised learning, and (3) dimensionality reduction, which are leveraged for the construction of an integrated low dimensional representation of the different imaging and non-imaging MRI protocols. Hierarchical classifiers for diagnosis and Gleason grading of CaP are then constructed within this unified low dimensional representation. Step 1 of the hierarchical classifier employs a random forest classifier in conjunction with the SeSMiK-GE based data representation and a probabilistic pairwise Markov Random Field algorithm (which allows for imposition of local spatial constraints) to yield a voxel based classification of CaP presence. The CaP region of interest identified in Step 1 is then subsequently classified as either high or low Gleason grade CaP in Step 2. Comparing SeSMiK-GE with unimodal T2w MRI, MRS classifiers and a commonly used feature concatenation (COD) strategy, yielded areas (AUC) under the receiver operative curve (ROC) of (a) 0.89. ?? 0.09 (SeSMiK), 0.54. ?? 0.18 (T2w MRI), 0.61. ?? 0.20 (MRS), and 0.64. ?? 0.23 (COD) for distinguishing benign from CaP regions, and (b) 0.84. ?? 0.07 (SeSMiK),0.54. ?? 0.13 (MRI), 0.59. ?? 0.19 (MRS), and 0.62. ??0.18 (COD) for distinguishing high and low grade CaP using a leave one out cross-validation strategy, all evaluations being performed on a per voxel basis. Our results suggest that following further rigorous validation, SeSMiK-GE could be developed into a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool for detection and grading of CaP in vivo and in helping to determine the appropriate treatment option. Identifying low grade disease in vivo might allow CaP patients to opt for active surveillance rather than immediately opt for aggressive therapy such as radical prostatectomy. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient measurements (ADCtumor and ADCratio ) and the Gleason score from radical prostatectomy specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-one patients with clinically localized prostate cancer scheduled for radical prostatectomy were prospectively enrolled. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed prior to prostatectomy and mean ADC values from both cancerous (ADCtumor ) and benign (ADCbenign ) tissue were measured to calculate the ADCratio (ADCtumor divided by ADCbenign ). The ADC measurements were correlated with the Gleason score from the prostatectomy specimens. RESULTS: The association between ADC measurements and Gleason score showed a significant negative correlation (P {\textless} 0.001) with Spearman's rho for ADCtumor (-0.421) and ADCratio (-0.649). There was a statistically significant difference between ADC measurements and the Gleason score for all tumors (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an overall area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73 (ADCtumor ) to 0.80 (ADCratio ) in discriminating Gleason score 6 from Gleason score ≥7 tumors. The AUC changed to 0.72 (ADCtumor ) and 0.90 (ADCratio ) when discriminating Gleason score ≤7(3+4) from Gleason score ≥7(4+3). CONCLUSION: ADC measurements showed a significant correlation with tumor Gleason score at final pathology. The ADCratio demonstrated the best correlation compared to the ADCtumor value and radically improved accuracy in discriminating Gleason score ≤7(3+4) from Gleason score ≥7(4+3) tumors.},

We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e. g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

Diffusional non-Gaussianity is a consequence of tissue structure that creates diffusion barriers and compartments. The degree of non-Gaussianity is conveniently quantified by the diffusional kurtosis and derivative metrics, such as the mean, axial, and radial kurtoses. DKI is a diffusion-weighted MRI technique that allows the diffusional kurtosis to be estimated with clinical scanners using standard diffusion-weighted pulse sequences and relatively modest acquisition times. DKI is an extension of the widely used diffusion tensor imaging method, but requires the use of at least 3 b-values and 15 diffusion directions. This review discusses the underlying theory of DKI as well as practical considerations related to data acquisition and post-processing. It is argued that the diffusional kurtosis is sensitive to diffusional heterogeneity and suggested that DKI may be useful for investigating ischemic stroke and neuropathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Development of CAD systems for detection of prostate cancer has been a recent topic of research. A multi-stage computer aided detection scheme is proposed to help reduce perception and oversight errors in multi-parametric prostate cancer screening MRI. In addition, important features for development of computer aided detection systems for prostate cancer screening MRI are identied. A fast, robust prostate segmentation routine is used to segment the prostate, based on coupled appearance and anatomy models. Subsequently a voxel classication is performed using a support vector machine to compute an abnormality likelihood map of the prostate. This classication step is based on quantitative voxel features like the apparent diusion coecient (ADC) and pharmacokinetic parameters. Local maxima in the likelihood map are found using a local maxima detector, after which regions around the local maxima are segmented. Region features are computed to represent statistical properties of the voxel features within the regions. Region classication is performed using these features, which results in a likelihood of abnormality per region. Performance was validated using a 188 patient dataset in a leave-one-patient-out manner. Ground truth was annotated by two expert radiologists. The results were evaluated using FROC analysis. The FROC curves show that inclusion of ADC and pharmacokinetic parameter features increases the performance of an automatic detection system. In addition it shows the potential of such an automated system in aiding radiologists diagnosing prostate MR, obtaining a sensitivity of respectively 74.7{\%} and 83.4{\%} at 7 and 9 false positives per patient.},

abstract = {With the wide array of multi scale, multi-modal data now available for disease characterization, the major challenge in integrated disease diagnostics is to able to represent the different data streams in a common framework while overcoming differences in scale and dimensionality. This common knowledge representation framework is an important pre-requisite to develop integrated meta-classifiers for disease classification. In this paper, we present a unified data fusion framework, Semi Supervised Multi Kernel Graph Embedding (SeSMiK-GE). Our method allows for representation of individual data modalities via a combined multi-kernel framework followed by semi- supervised dimensionality reduction, where partial label information is incorporated to embed high dimensional data in a reduced space. In this work we evaluate SeSMiK-GE for distinguishing (a) benign from cancerous (CaP) areas, and (b) aggressive high-grade prostate cancer from indolent low-grade by integrating information from 1.5 Tesla in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (anatomic) and Spectroscopy (metabolic). Comparing SeSMiK-GE with unimodal T2w, MRS classifiers and a previous published non-linear dimensionality reduction driven combination scheme (ScEPTre) yielded classification accuracies of (a) 91.3{\%} (SeSMiK), 66.1{\%} (MRI), 82.6{\%} (MRS) and 86.8{\%} (ScEPTre) for distinguishing benign from CaP regions, and (b) 87.5{\%} (SeSMiK), 79.8{\%} (MRI), 83.7{\%} (MRS) and 83.9{\%} (ScEPTre) for distinguishing high and low grade CaP over a total of 19 multi-modal MRI patient studies.},

They are the magnitudes of a set of orthogonal complex moments of the image known as Zernike moments. Scale and translation invariance are obtained by first nor-malizing the image with respect to these parameters using its regular geometrical moments. A systematic reconstruction-based method for deciding the highest order of Zernike moments required in a classifi-cation problem is developed. The " quality " of the reconstructed image is examined through its comparison to the original one. More moments are included until the reconstructed image from them is close enough to the original picture. The orthogonality property of the Zernike mo-ments which simplifies the process of image reconstruction makes the suggested feature selection approach practical. Furthermore, features of each order can also be weighted according to their contribution (their image representation ability) to the reconstruction process. The method is tested using clean and noisy images from a 26-class character data set and a 4-class lake data set. The superiority of Zernike moment fea-tures over regular moments and moment invariants is experimentally verified.

abstract = {In recent years, the effect of the curse of high dimensionality has been studied in great detail on several problems such as clustering, nearest neighbor search, and indexing. In high dimensional space the data becomes sparse, and traditional indexing and algorithmic techniques fail from a effciency and/or effectiveness perspective. Recent research results show that in high dimensional space, the concept of proximity, distance or nearest neighbor may not even be qualitatively meaningful. In this paper, we view the dimensionality curse from the point of view of the distance metrics which are used to measure the similarity between objects. We specifically examine the behavior of the commonly used L k norm and show that the problem of meaningfulness in high dimensionality is sensitive to the value of k. For example, this means that the Manhattan distance metric L(1 norm) is consistently more preferable than the Euclidean distance metric L(2 norm) for high dimensional data mining applications. Using the intuition derived from our analysis, we introduce and examine a natural extension of the L k norm to fractional distance metrics. We show that the fractional distance metric provides more meaningful results both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. The results show that fractional distance metrics can significantly improve the effectiveness of standard clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional computerized characterization of biomedical solid textures is key to large-scale and high-throughput screening of imaging data. Such data increasingly become available in the clinical and research environments with an ever increasing spatial resolution. In this text we exhaustively analyze the state-of-the-art in 3-D biomedical texture analysis to identify the specific needs of the application domains and extract promising trends in image processing algorithms. The geometrical properties of biomedical textures are studied both in their natural space and on digitized lattices. It is found that most of the tissue types have strong multi-scale directional properties, that are well captured by imaging protocols with high resolutions and spherical spatial transfer functions. The information modeled by the various image processing techniques is analyzed and visualized by displaying their 3-D texture primitives. We demonstrate that non-convolutional approaches are expected to provide best results when the size of structures are inferior to five voxels. For larger structures, it is shown that only multi-scale directional convolutional approaches that are non-separable allow for an unbiased modeling of 3-D biomedical textures. With the increase of high-resolution isotropic imaging protocols in clinical routine and research, these models are expected to best leverage the wealth of 3-D biomedical texture analysis in the future. Future research directions and opportunities are proposed to efficiently model personalized image-based phenotypes of normal biomedical tissue and its alterations. The integration of the clinical and genomic context is expected to better explain the intra class variation of healthy biomedical textures. Using texture synthesis, this provides the exciting opportunity to simulate and visualize texture atlases of normal ageing process and disease progression for enhanced treatment planning and clinical care management. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper is directed towards the development of a novel Computer-aided Diagnosis (CADx) system for the diagnosis of breast masses. It aims at intensifying the performance of CADx algorithms as well as reducing the FNR by utilizing Zernike moments as descriptors of shape and margin characteristics. The input Regions of Interest (ROIs) are segmented manually and further subjected to a number of preprocessing stages. The outcomes of preprocessing stage are two processed images containing co-scaled translated masses. Besides, one of these images represents the shape characteristics of the mass, while the other describes the margin characteristics. Two groups of Zernike moments have been extracted from the preprocessed images and applied to the feature selection stage. Each group includes 32 moments with different orders and iterations. Considering the performance of the overall CADx system, the most effective moments have been chosen and applied to a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, employing both generic Back Propagation (BP) and Opposition-based Learning (OBL) algorithms. The Receiver Operational Characteristics (ROC) curve and the performance of resulting CADx systems are analyzed for each group of features. The designed systems yield Az=0.976, representing fair sensitivity, and Az=0.975 demonstrating fair specificity. The best achieved FNR and FPR are 0.0{\%} and 5.5{\%}, respectively. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: ROC curves have become the standard for describing and comparing the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Not surprisingly, ROC curves are used often by clinical chemists. Our aims were to observe how the accuracy of clinical laboratory diagnostic tests is assessed, compared, and reported in the literature; to identify common problems with the use of ROC curves; and to offer some possible solutions. METHODS: We reviewed every original work using ROC curves and published in Clinical Chemistry in 2001 or 2002. For each article we recorded phase of the research, prospective or retrospective design, sample size, presence/absence of confidence intervals (CIs), nature of the statistical analysis, and major analysis problems. RESULTS: Of 58 articles, 31{\%} were phase I (exploratory), 50{\%} were phase II (challenge), and 19{\%} were phase III (advanced) studies. The studies increased in sample size from phase I to III and showed a progression in the use of prospective designs. Most phase I studies were powered to assess diagnostic tests with ROC areas {\textgreater}/=0.70. Thirty-eight percent of studies failed to include CIs for diagnostic test accuracy or the CIs were constructed inappropriately. Thirty-three percent of studies provided insufficient analysis for comparing diagnostic tests. Other problems included dichotomization of the gold standard scale and inappropriate analysis of the equivalence of two diagnostic tests. CONCLUSION: We identify available software and make some suggestions for sample size determination, testing for equivalence in diagnostic accuracy, and alternatives to a dichotomous classification of a continuous-scale gold standard. More methodologic research is needed in areas specific to clinical chemistry.},

abstract = {It is suggested that it may be possible to transmit speech and music in much narrower wavebands than was hitherto thought necessary, not by clipping the ends of the waveband, but by condensing the information. Two possibilities of more economical transmission are discussed. Both have in common that the original waveband is compressed in transmission and re-expanded to the original width in reception. In the first or "kinematical" method a temporary or permanent record is scanned by moving slits or their equivalents, which replace one another in continuous succession before a "window." Mathematical analysis is simplest if the transmission of the window is graded according to a probability function. A simple harmonic oscillation is reproduced as a group of spectral lines with frequencies which have an approximately constant ratio to the original frequency. The average departure from the law of proportional conversion is in inverse ratio to the time interval in which the record passes before the window. Experiments carried out with simple apparatus indicate that speech can be compressed into a frequency band of 800 or even 500 c/s without losing much of its intelligibility. There are various possibilities for utilizing frequency compression in telephony by means of the "kinematical" method. In a second method the compression and expansion are carried out electrically, without mechanical motion. This method consists essentially in using non-sinusoidal carriers, such as repeated probability pulses, and local oscillators producing waves of the same type. It is shown that one variety of the electrical method is mathematically equivalent to the kinematical method of frequency conversion.},

For JHH, there was exact agreement between biopsy and RP in 58{\%} and agreement to within one digit in 93{\%} of cases, compared with 34{\%} and 67{\%}, respectively, for non-JHH. Combining cases into more meaningful groups (Gleason 2-4, 5-6, 7, and 8-10), there was 66{\%} exact correlation between the biopsy and RP for JHH as compared with 45{\%} for non- JHH. Non-JHH undergraded biopsy results more than JHH, with 22.3{\%} and 1.2{\%} Gleason score 2-4, respectively. None of the cases with a Gleason score of 2-4 on biopsy from JHH or non-JHH were Gleason score 2-4 on RP. Fifty-five percent of the tumors with non-JHH needle biopsy results graded Gleason 2-4 had either capsular penetration, seminal vesicle, or lymph node involvement. All of the tumors with needle Gleason score 2-4 at JHH were organ confined. The JHH needle biopsy grade correlated better with pathologic stage than did non- JHH (R = 0.27 JHH vs. R = 0.12 non-JHH). Extent of cancer in the biopsy sample was not a factor in the accuracy of predicting RP grade or stage. Eighty-two cases evaluated at JHH were signed out by a genitourinary pathologist; the grading of the biopsy samples by other JHH pathologists was just as accurate. Gleason score of {\textgreater}=7 on the biopsy sample predicted a Gleason score of {\textgreater}=7 in the RP 87.5{\%} of the time. A Gleason score of {\textless}7 predicted a Gleason score of {\textless}7 only 63.9{\%} of the time. Discordant grades in some cases reflected patterns of cancer on needle biopsy that were borderline between two different Gleason scores. Sampling was the major source of discrepancy and was often due to the high-grade component in the RP not being present in the biopsy results or due to a component of cancer on the needle reflecting such a small percentage of the pattern seen on RP that this pattern was not included in the final RP Gleason score.},

A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been shown to have great clinical potential as a supplement to magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer (CaP). MRS provides functional information in the form of changes in the relative concentration of specific metabolites including choline, creatine, and citrate which can be used to identify potential areas of CaP. With a view to assisting radiologists in interpretation and analysis of MRS data, some researchers have begun to develop computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes for CaP identification from spectroscopy. Most of these schemes have been centered on identifying and integrating the area under metabolite peaks which is then used to compute relative metabolite ratios. However, manual identification of metabolite peaks on the MR spectra, and especially via CAD, is a challenging problem due to low signal-to-noise ratio, baseline irregularity, peak overlap, and peak distortion. In this article the authors present a novel CAD scheme that integrates nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) with an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to automatically identify suspicious regions on the prostate using MRS and hence avoids the need to explicitly identify metabolite peaks. The methodology comprises two stages. In stage 1, a hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm is used to distinguish between extracapsular and prostatic spectra in order to localize the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the prostate. Once the prostate ROI is localized, in stage 2, a NLDR scheme, in conjunction with a replicated clustering algorithm, is used to automatically discriminate between three classes of spectra (normal appearing, suspicious appearing, and indeterminate). The methodology was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on a total of 18 1.5 T in vivo prostate T2-weighted (w) and MRS studies obtained from the multisite, multi-institutional American College of Radiology (ACRIN) trial. In the absence of the precise ground truth for CaP extent on the MR imaging for most of the ACRIN studies, probabilistic quantitative metrics were defined based on partial knowledge on the quadrant location and size of the tumor. The scheme, when evaluated against this partial ground truth, was found to have a CaP detection sensitivity of 89.33{\%} and specificity of 79.79{\%}. The results obtained from randomized threefold and fivefold cross validation suggest that the NLDR based clustering scheme has a higher CaP detection accuracy compared to such commonly used MRS analysis schemes as z score and PCA. In addition, the scheme was found to be robust to changes in system parameters. For 6 of the 18 studies an expert radiologist laboriously labeled each of the individual spectra according to a five point scale, with 1/2 representing spectra that the expert considered normal and 3/4/5 being spectra the expert deemed suspicious. When evaluated on these expert annotated datasets, the CAD system yielded an average sensitivity (cluster corresponding to suspicious spectra being identified as the CaP class) and specificity of 81.39{\%} and 64.71{\%}, respectively.},

abstract = {Large number of dimensions not only cause clutter in multi-dimensional visualizations, but also make it difficult for users to navigate the data space. Effective dimension management, such as dimension ordering, spacing and filtering, is critical for visual exploration of such datasets. Dimension ordering and spacing explicitly reveal dimension relationships in arrangement-sensitive multidimensional visualization techniques, such as parallel coordinates, star glyphs, and pixel-oriented techniques. They facilitate the visual discovery of patterns within the data. Dimension filtering hides some of the dimensions to reduce clutter while preserving the major information of the dataset. In this paper, we propose an interactive hierarchical dimension ordering, spacing and filtering approach, called DOSFA. DOSFA is based on dimension hierarchies derived from similarities among dimensions. It is scalable multi-resolution approach making dimensional management a tractable task. On the one hand, it automatically generates default settings for dimension ordering, spacing and filtering. On the other hand, it allows users to efficiently control all aspects of this dimension management process via visual interaction tools for dimension hierarchy manipulation. A case study visualizing a dataset containing over 200 dimensions reveals high dimensional visualization techniques.},

It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject. Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.},

abstract = {Classically, analysis on manifolds and graphs has been based on the study of the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian and its generalizations. These objects from differential geometry and analysis on manifolds have proven useful in applications to partial differential equations, and their discrete counterparts have been applied to optimization problems, learning, clustering, routing and many other algorithms. The eigenfunctions of the Laplacian are in general global: their support often coincides with the whole manifold, and they are affected by global properties of the manifold (for example certain global topological invariants). Recently a framework for building natural multiresolution structures on manifolds and graphs was introduced, that greatly generalizes, among other things, the construction of wavelets and wavelet packets in Euclidean spaces. This allows the study of the manifold and of functions on it at different scales, which are naturally induced by the geometry of the manifold. This construction proceeds bottom-up, from the finest scale to the coarsest scale, using powers of a diffusion operator as dilations and a numerical rank constraint to critically sample the multiresolution subspaces. In this paper we introduce a novel multiscale construction, based on a top-down recursive partitioning induced by the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. This yields associated local cosine packets onmanifolds, generalizing local cosines in Euclidean spaces. We discuss some of the connections with the construction of diffusion wavelets. These constructions have direct applications to the approximation, denoising, compression and learning of functions on a manifold and are promising in view of applications to problems in manifold approximation, learning, dimensionality reduction.},

abstract = {Background: Screening for prostate cancer advances the time of diagnosis (lead time) and detects cancers that would not have been diagnosed in the absence of screening (overdetection). Both consequences have considerable impact on the net benefits of screening. Methods: We developed simulation models based on results of the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), which enrolled 42 376 men and in which 1498 cases of prostate cancer were identified, and on baseline prostate cancer incidence and stage distribution data. The models were used to predict mean lead times, overdetection rates, and ranges (corresponding to approximate 95{\%} confidence intervals) associated with different screening programs. Results: Mean lead times and rates of overdetection depended on a man's age at screening. For a single screening test at age 55, the estimated mean lead time was 12.3 years (range = 11.6-14.1 years) and the overdetection rate was 27{\%} (range = 24{\%}-37{\%}); at age 75, the estimates were 6.0 years (range = 5.8-6.3 years) and 56{\%} (range = 53{\%}-61{\%}), respectively. For a screening program with a 4-year screening interval from age 55 to 67, the estimated mean lead time was 11.2 years (range = 10.8-12.1 years), and the overdetection rate was 48{\%} (range = 44{\%}-55{\%}). This screening program raised the lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis from 6.4{\%} to 10.6{\%}, a relative increase of 65{\%} (range = 56{\%}-87{\%}). In annual screening from age 55 to 67, the estimated overdetection rate was 50{\%} (range = 46{\%}-57{\%}) and the lifetime prostate cancer risk was increased by 80{\%} (range = 69{\%}-116{\%}). Extending annual or quadrennial screening to the age of 75 would result in at least two cases of overdetection for every clinically relevant cancer detected. Conclusions: These model-based lead-time estimates support a prostate cancer screening interval of more than 1 year.},

The threshold area of discrimination appears to be independent of the duration of the signals between about 20 and 250 millisec.

Visual information plays an important role in our society, it will play an increasingly pervasive role in our lives, and there will be a growing need to have these sources processed further.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Through the wealth of information contained within them, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to provide researchers with a systematic means of associating genetic variants with a wide variety of disease phenotypes. Due to the limitations of approaches that have analyzed single variants one at a time, it has been proposed that the genetic basis of these disorders could be determined through detailed analysis of the genetic variants themselves and in conjunction with one another. The construction of models that account for these subsets of variants requires methodologies that generate predictions based on the total risk of a particular group of polymorphisms. However, due to the excessive number of variants, constructing these types of models has so far been computationally infeasible.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We have implemented an algorithm, known as greedy RLS, that we use to perform the first known wrapper-based feature selection on the genome-wide level. The running time of greedy RLS grows linearly in the number of training examples, the number of features in the original data set, and the number of selected features. This speed is achieved through computational short-cuts based on matrix calculus. Since the memory consumption in present-day computers can form an even tighter bottleneck than running time, we also developed a space efficient variation of greedy RLS which trades running time for memory. These approaches are then compared to traditional wrapper-based feature selection implementations based on support vector machines (SVM) to reveal the relative speed-up and to assess the feasibility of the new algorithm. As a proof of concept, we apply greedy RLS to the Hypertension - UK National Blood Service WTCCC dataset and select the most predictive variants using 3-fold external cross-validation in less than 26 minutes on a high-end desktop. On this dataset, we also show that greedy RLS has a better classification performance on independent test data than a classifier trained using features selected by a statistical p-value-based filter, which is currently the most popular approach for constructing predictive models in GWAS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Greedy RLS is the first known implementation of a machine learning based method with the capability to conduct a wrapper-based feature selection on an entire GWAS containing several thousand examples and over 400,000 variants. In our experiments, greedy RLS selected a highly predictive subset of genetic variants in a fraction of the time spent by wrapper-based selection methods used together with SVM classifiers. The proposed algorithms are freely available as part of the RLScore software library at http://users.utu.fi/aatapa/RLScore/.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Survival for high-grade gliomas is poor, at least partly explained by intratumoral heterogeneity contributing to treatment resistance. Radiological evaluation of treatment response is in most cases limited to assessment of tumor size months after the initiation of therapy. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its estimate of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been widely investigated, as it reflects tumor cellularity and proliferation. The aim of this study was to investigate texture analysis of ADC images in conjunction with multivariate image analysis as a means for identification of pretreatment imaging biomarkers. METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive high-grade glioma patients were treated with radiotherapy (2 Gy/60 Gy) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide. ADC maps and T1-weighted anatomical images with and without contrast enhancement were collected prior to treatment, and (residual) tumor contrast enhancement was delineated. A gray-level co-occurrence matrix analysis was performed on the ADC maps in a cuboid encapsulating the tumor in coronal, sagittal, and transversal planes, giving a total of 60 textural descriptors for each tumor. In addition, similar examinations and analyses were performed at day 1, week 2, and week 6 into treatment. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality of the data, and the five largest components (scores) were used in subsequent analyses. MRI assessment three months after completion of radiochemotherapy was used for classifying tumor progression or regression. RESULTS: The score scatter plots revealed that the first, third, and fifth components of the pretreatment examinations exhibited a pattern that strongly correlated to survival. Two groups could be identified: one with a median survival after diagnosis of 1099 days and one with 345 days, p = 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: By combining PCA and texture analysis, ADC texture characteristics were identified, which seems to hold pretreatment prognostic information, independent of known prognostic factors such as age, stage, and surgical procedure. These findings encourage further studies with a larger patient cohort.},

abstract = {The problem of image texture analysis is introduced, and existing approaches are surveyed. An empirical evaluation method is applied to two texture measurement systems, co-occurrence statistics and augmented correlation statistics. A spatial-statistical class of texture measures is then defined and evaluated. It leads to a simple class of texture energy transforms, which perform better than any of the preceding methods. These transforms are very fast, and can be made invariant to changes in luminance, contrast, and rotation without histogram equalization or other preprocessing. Texture energy is measured by filtering with small masks, typically 5x5, then with a moving-window average of the absolute image values. This method, similar to human visual processing, is appropriate for textures with short coherence length or correlation distance. The filter masks are integer-valued and separable, and can be implemented with one-dimensional or 3x3 convolutions. The averaging operation is also very fast, with computing time independent of window size. Texture energy planes may be linearly combined to form a smaller number of discriminant planes. These principal component planes seem to represent natural texture dimensions, and to be more reliable texture measures than the texture energy planes. Texture segmentation or classification may be accomplished using either texture energy or principal component planes as input. This study classified 15x15 blocks of eight natural textures. Accuracies of 72{\%} were achieved with co- occurrence statistics, 65{\%} with augmented correlation statistics, and 94{\%} with texture energy statistics.},

abstract = {Extracting rotation invariant features is a valuable technique for the effective classification of rotation invariant texture. The Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm has been proved to be theoretically simple, and has been applied in many areas. Also, the co-occurrence HOG (CoHOG) algorithm provides a unified description including both statistical and differential properties of a texture patch. However, HOG and CoHOG have some shortcomings: they discard some important texture information and are not invariant to rotation. In this paper, based on the original HOG and CoHOG algorithms, four novel feature extraction methods are proposed. The first method uses Gaussian derivative filters named GDF-HOG. The second and the third methods use eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix named Eig(Hess)-HOG and Eig(Hess)-CoHOG, respectively. The fourth method exploits the Gaussian and means curvatures to calculate curvatures of the image surface named GM-CoHOG. We have empirically shown that the proposed novel extended HOG and CoHOG methods provide useful information for rotation invariance. The classification results are compared with original HOG and CoHOG algorithms methods on the CUReT, KTH-TIPS, KTH-TIPS2-a and UIUC datasets show that proposed four methods achieve best classification result on all datasets. In addition, we make a comparison with several well-known descriptors. The experiments of rotation invariant analysis are carried out on the Brodatz dataset, and promising results are obtained from those experiments.},

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation.

The local Ethics Committee approved this prospective study of 93 patients (median age, 65 years), who underwent 1.5 T multiparametric endorectal MR imaging before prostatectomy. Clinically significant (volume ≥0.5 ml) peripheral tumours were outlined on histological sections, contoured on T2w and ADC images, and their pathological Gleason Score (pGS) was recorded. C, H, and traditional ADC metrics (mean, median, 10th and 25th percentile) were calculated on the largest lesion slice, and correlated with the pGS through the Spearman correlation coefficient. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) assessed how parameters differentiate pGS = 6 from pGS ≥ 7. The dataset included 49 clinically significant PCas with a balanced distribution of pGS. The Spearman $\rho$ and AUC values on ADC were: -0.489, 0.823 (mean); -0.522, 0.821 (median); -0.569, 0.854 (10th percentile); -0.556, 0.854 (25th percentile); -0.386, 0.871 (C); 0.533, 0.923 (H); while on T2w they were: -0.654, 0.945 (C); 0.645, 0.962 (H). AUC of H on ADC and T2w, and C on T2w were significantly higher than that of the mean ADC (p = 0.05). H and C calculated on T2w images outperform ADC parameters in correlating with pGS and differentiating low- from intermediate/high-risk PCas, supporting the role of T2w MR imaging in assessing PCa biological aggressiveness.},

However, ultra-high b-value imaging is difficult to achieve at a high signal-to-noise ratio due to hardware limitations. An alternative approach being recently discussed is computed diffusion-weighted imaging, which allows for estimation of ultra-high b-value images from a set of diffusion-weighted acquisitions with different magnetic gradient strengths. This paper presents a quantitative investigative analysis of the improvement in tumour separability in the prostate gland from using ultra-high b-value computed diffusion-weighted imaging. The analysis computes ultra-high b-value images for six patient cases and investigates the separability of the tumour from the normal prostate gland. Based on quantitative metrics such as expected probability of classification error and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), it was found that the use of ultra-high computed diffusion-weighted imaging may significantly improve tumour separability, with a b-value around 3000 providing optimal separability.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate four mathematical models for diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of prostate cancer (PCa) in terms of PCa detection and characterization. METHODS: Fifty patients with histologically confirmed PCa underwent two repeated 3 Tesla DWI examinations using 12 equally distributed b values, the highest b value of 2000 s/mm(2) . Normalized mean signal intensities of regions-of-interest were fitted using monoexponential, kurtosis, stretched exponential, and biexponential models. Tumors were classified into low, intermediate, and high Gleason score groups. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were estimated to evaluate performance in PCa detection and Gleason score classifications. The fitted parameters were correlated with Gleason score groups by using the Spearman correlation coefficient ($\rho$). Coefficient of repeatability and intraclass correlation coefficient [specifically ICC(3,1)], were calculated to evaluate repeatability of the fitted parameters. RESULTS: The AUC and $\rho$ values were similar between parameters of monoexponential, kurtosis, and stretched exponential (with the exception of the $\alpha$ parameter) models. The absolute $\rho$ values for ADCm , ADCk , K, and ADCs were in the range from 0.31 to 0.53 (P {\textless} 0.01). Parameters of the biexponential model demonstrated low repeatability. CONCLUSION: In region-of-interest based analysis, the monoexponential model for DWI of PCa using b values up to 2000 s/mm(2) was sufficient for PCa detection and characterization.

The correspondence between the area under an ROC curve and the Wilcoxon statistic is used and underlying Gaussian distributions (binormal) are assumed to provide a table that converts the observed correlations in paired ratings of images into a correlation between the two ROC areas. This between-area correlation can be used to reduce the standard error (uncertainty) about the observed difference in areas. This correction for pairing, analogous to that used in the paired t-test, can produce a considerable increase in the statistical sensitivity (power) of the comparison.

In the second step, for each MR study these parameters are used to map their histogram into the standardized histogram. The method was tested quantitatively on 90 whole-brain studies of multiple sclerosis patients for several protocols and qualitatively for several other protocols and body regions. Measurements using mean squared difference showed that the standardized image intensities have statistically significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) more consistent range and meaning than the originals. Fixed gray level windows can be established for the standardized images and used for display without the need of per case adjustment.

abstract = {Calculation of co-occurrence probabilities is a popular method for determining texture features within remotely sensed digital imagery. Typically, the co-occurrence features are calculated by using a grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to store the co-occurring probabilities. Statistics are applied to the probabilities in the GLCM to generate the texture features. This method is computationally intensive since the matrix is usually sparse leading to many unnecessary calculations involving zero probabilities when applying the statistics. An improvement on the GLCM method is to utilize a grey level co-occurrence linked list (GLCLL) to store only the non-zero co-occurring probabilities. The GLCLL suffers since, to achieve preferred computational speeds, the list should be sorted. An improvement on the GLCLL is to utilize a grey level co-occurrence hybrid structure (GLCHS) based on an integrated hash table and linked list approach. Texture features obtained using this technique are identical to those obtained using the GLCM and GLCLL. The GLCHS method is implemented using the C language in a Unix environment. Based on a Brodatz test image, the GLCHS method is demonstrated to be a superior technique when compared across various window sizes and grey level quantizations. The GLCHS method required, on average, 33.4{\%} ($\sigma$=3.08{\%}) of the computational time required by the GLCLL. Significant computational gains are made using the GLCHS method.},

abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new can-cer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States in the current year and com-piles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. Incidence data were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2017, 1,688,780 new cancer cases and 600,920 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. For all sites combined, the cancer incidence rate is 20{\%} higher in men than in women, while the cancer death rate is 40{\%} higher. However, sex disparities vary by cancer type. For example, thyroid cancer incidence rates are 3-fold higher in women than in men (21 vs 7 per 100,000 population), despite equivalent death rates (0.5 per 100,000 population), largely reflecting sex differences in the " epidemic of diag-nosis. " Over the past decade of available data, the overall cancer incidence rate (2004-2013) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2{\%} annually in men, while the cancer death rate (2005-2014) declined by about 1.5{\%} annually in both men and women. From 1991 to 2014, the overall cancer death rate dropped 25{\%}, translating to approxi-mately 2,143,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Although the cancer death rate was 15{\%} higher in blacks than in whites in 2014, increasing access to care as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may expedite the narrowing racial gap; from 2010 to 2015, the proportion of blacks who were uninsured halved, from 21{\%} to 11{\%}, as it did for Hispanics (31{\%} to 16{\%}). Gains in coverage for traditionally underserved Americans will facilitate the broader application of existing cancer control knowledge across every segment of the population.},

abstract = {Recently, both Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) have emerged as promising tools for detection of prostate cancer (CaP). However, due to the inherent dimensionality differences in MR imaging and spec- tral information, quantitative integration of T2 weighted MRI (T2w MRI) and MRS for improved CaP detection has been a major challenge. In this paper, we present a novel computerized decision support system called multimodal wavelet embedding representation for data combination (MaWERiC) that employs, (i) wavelet theory to extract 171 Haar wavelet features from MRS and 54 Gabor features from T2w MRI, (ii) dimensionality reduction to individually project wavelet features from MRS and T2wMRI into a common reduced Eigen vector space, and (iii), a random forest classifier for automated prostate cancer detection on a per voxel basis from combined 1.5 T in vivo MRI and MRS. A total of 36 1.5 T endorectal in vivo T2w MRI and MRS patient studies were evaluated per voxel by MaWERiC using a three-fold cross validation approach over 25 iterations. Ground truth for evaluation of results was obtained by an expert radiologist annotations of prostate cancer on a per voxel basis who compared each MRI section with corresponding ex vivo wholemount histology sections with the disease extent mapped out on histology. Results suggest that MaWERiC based MRS T2w meta-classifier (mean AUC, m=0.89?0.02) significantly outperformed (i) a T2w MRI (using wavelet texture features) classifier (m=0.55?0.02), (ii) a MRS (using metabolite ratios) classifier (m=0.77?0.03), (iii) a decision fusion classifier obtained by combining individual T2w MRI and MRS classifier outputs (m=0.85?0.03), and (iv) a data combination method involving a combination of metabolic MRS and MR signal intensity features (m=0.66?0.02).

abstract = {The Gleason system for prostate cancer was based on a study of 270 patients from the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Hospital in 1966-1967. In 1974, Gleason and the Veterans Administrative Cooperative Urological Research Group expanded this study to 1032 men. These studies formed the basis of the Gleason grading system, which is now endorsed as the primary grading system for prostate cancer by the World Health Organization, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Fascicle on prostate cancer, the Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology, and the College of American Pathologists. In the nearly 40 years since its inception, several aspects about prostate cancer and its management have changed, most notably serum prostate-specific antigen, transrectal ultrasonography, 18-gauge needle biopsy sampling, immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of cancer, and radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy as primary treatment modalities. Several aspects of the disease, and consequently the reporting needs, have changed such as reporting cancer on multiple cases in needle biopsies, multiple nodules in prostatectomy, tertiary patterns, variants and variations in prostate cancer. The application of the Gleason system, therefore, has varied considerably in contemporary surgical pathology practice. An International Consensus Conference attended by 80 urologic pathologists from 20 countries was convened to discuss clarifications and modifications to the Gleason system. This article serves as a brief overview and summary of the proceedings that have been published in detail in recent literature.},

abstract = {The major challenge with classifying high dimensional biomedical data is in identifying the appropriate feature representation to (a) overcome the curse of dimensionality, and (b) facilitate separation between the data classes. Another challenge is to integrate information from two disparate modalities, possibly existing in different dimensional spaces, for improved classification. In this paper, we present a novel data representation, integration and classification scheme, Spectral Embedding based Probabilistic boosting Tree (ScEPTre), which incorporates Spectral Embedding (SE) for data representation and integration and a Probabilistic Boosting Tree classifier for data classification. SE provides an alternate representation of the data by non-linearly transforming high dimensional data into a low dimensional embedding space such that the relative adjacencies between objects are preserved. We demonstrate the utility of ScEPTre to classify and integrate Magnetic Resonance (MR) Spectroscopy (MRS) and Imaging (MRI) data for prostate cancer detection. Area under the receiver operating Curve (AUC) obtained via randomized cross validation on 15 prostate MRI-MRS studies suggests that (a) ScEPTre on MRS significantly outperforms a Haar wavelets based classifier, (b) integration of MRI-MRS via ScEPTre performs significantly better compared to using MRI and MRS alone, and (c) data integration via ScEPTre yields superior classification results compared to combining decisions from individual classifiers (or modalities).},

abstract = {In this paper, the effect of grey level quantization on the ability of co-occurrence probability statistics to classify natural textures is studied. Generally, as a function of increasing grey levels, many of the statistics demonstrate a decrease in classification ability while a few maintain constant classification accuracy. None of the individual statistics show increasing classification accuracy throughout all grey levels. Correlation analysis is used to rationalize a preferred subset of statistics. The preferred statistics set (contrast, correlation, and entropy) is demonstrated to be an improvement over using single statistics or using the entire set of statistics. If the feature space dimension only allows for a single statistic, one of contrast, dissimilarity, inverse difference normalized, or inverse difference moment normalized, is recommended. Testing that compares (using all orientations separately), the average of all orientations and look direction averaging, when determining the co-occurrence features, indicates that the look direction or all orientations is preferred. The Fisher linear discriminant method is used for all classification testing. The Fisher criterion is used as a separability index to provide insight into the classification results. Testing is performed on Brodatz imagery as well as two separate SAR sea-ice data sets.},

abstract = {A 2D Gabor filter can be realized as a sinusoidal plane wave of some frequency and orientation within a two dimensional Gaussian envelope. Its spatial extent, frequency and orientation preferences as well as bandwidths are easily controlled by the parameters used in generating the filters. However, there is an "uncertainty relation" associated with linear filters which limits the resolution simultaneously attainable in space and frequency. Daugman (1985) has determined that 2D Gabor filters are members of a class of functions achieving optimal joint resolution in the 2D space and 2D frequency domains. They have also been found to be a good model for two dimensional receptive fields of simple cells in the striate cortex (Jones 1985; Jones et al. 1985). The characteristic of optimal joint resolution in both space and frequency suggests that these filters are appropriate operators for tasks requiring simultaneous measurement in these domains. Texture discrimination is such a task. Computer application of a set of Gabor filters to a variety of textures found to be preattentively discriminable produces results in which differently textured regions are distinguished by first-order differences in the values measured by the filters. This ability to reduce the statistical complexity distinguishing differently textured region as well as the sensitivity of these filters to certain types of local features suggest that Gabor functions can act as detectors of certain "texton" types. The performance of the computer models suggests that cortical neurons with Gabor like receptive fields may be involved in preattentive texture discrimination.},

abstract = {We propose a new method for prostate cancer classification based on supervised statistical learning methods by integrating T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI images with targeted prostate biopsy results. In the first step of the method, all three imaging modalities are registered based on the image coordinates encoded in the DICOM images. In the second step, local statistical features are extracted in each imaging modality to capture intensity, shape, and texture information at every biopsy target. Finally, using support vector machines, supervised learning is conducted with the biopsy results to train a classification system that predicts the pathology of suspicious cancer lesions. The algorithm was tested with a dataset of 54 patients that underwent 164 targeted biopsies (58 positive, 106 negative). The proposed tri-modal MRI algorithm shows significant improvement over a similar approach that utilizes only T2-weighted MRI images (p= 0.048). The areas under the ROC curve for these methods were 0.82 (95{\%} CI: [0.71, 0.93]) and 0.73 (95{\%} CI: [0.55, 0.84]), respectively. {\textcopyright} 2013 SPIE.},

abstract = {In this paper, a fully automatic computer-aided detection (CAD) method is proposed for the detection of prostate cancer. The CAD method consists of multiple sequential steps in order to detect locations that are suspicious for prostate cancer. In the initial stage, a voxel classification is performed using a Hessian-based blob detection algorithm at multiple scales on an apparent diffusion coefficient map. Next, a parametric multi-object segmentation method is applied and the resulting segmentation is used as a mask to restrict the candidate detection to the prostate. The remaining candidates are characterized by performing histogram analysis on multiparametric MR images. The resulting feature set is summarized into a malignancy likelihood by a supervised classifier in a two-stage classification approach. The detection performance for prostate cancer was tested on a screening population of 200 consecutive patients and evaluated using the free response operating characteristic methodology. The results show that the CAD method obtained sensitivities of 0.41, 0.65 and 0.74 at false positive (FP) levels of 1, 3 and 5 per patient, respectively. In conclusion, this study showed that it is feasible to automatically detect prostate cancer at a FP rate lower than systematic biopsy. The CAD method may assist the radiologist to detect prostate cancer locations and could potentially guide biopsy towards the most aggressive part of the tumour.},

abstract = {One of the major drawbacks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the lack of a standard and quantifiable interpretation of image intensities. Unlike in other modalities, such as X-ray computerized tomography, MR images taken for the same patient on the same scanner at different times may appear different from each other due to a variety of scanner-dependent variations and, therefore, the absolute intensity values do not have a fixed meaning. We have devised a two-step method wherein all images (independent of patients and the specific brand of the MR scanner used) can be transformed in such a way that for the same protocol and body region, in the transformed images similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. Standardized images can be displayed with fixed windows without the need of per-case adjustment. More importantly, extraction of quantitative information about healthy organs or about abnormalities can be considerably simplified. This paper introduces and compares new variants of this standardizing method that can help to overcome some of the problems with the original method.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Optimal b-value distributions for the fit of three parameters (fast diffusion Df, slow diffusion Ds, and fraction of fast diffusion f) were determined using Monte-Carlo simulations. The optimal b-value distribution was calculated using four individual optimization methods. Eight healthy volunteers underwent four repeated 3 Tesla prostate DWI scans using both 16 equally distributed b-values and an optimized b-value distribution obtained from the simulations. The b-value distributions were compared in terms of measurement reliability and repeatability using Shrout-Fleiss analysis. RESULTS: Using low noise levels, the optimal b-value distribution formed three separate clusters at low (0-400 s/mm2), mid-range (650-1200 s/mm2), and high b-values (1700-2000 s/mm2). Higher noise levels resulted into less pronounced clustering of b-values. The clustered optimized b-value distribution demonstrated better measurement reliability and repeatability in Shrout-Fleiss analysis compared with 16 equally distributed b-values. CONCLUSION: The optimal b-value distribution was found to be a clustered distribution with b-values concentrated in the low, mid, and high ranges and was shown to improve the estimation quality of biexponential DWI parameters of in vivo experiments.},

abstract = {The C statistic is a commonly reported measure of screening test performance. Optimistic estimation of the C statistic is a frequent problem because of overfitting of statistical models in small data sets, and methods exist to correct for this issue. However, many studies do not use such methods, and those that do correct for optimism use diverse methods, some of which are known to be biased. We used clinical data sets (United Kingdom Down syndrome screening data from Glasgow (1991-2003), Edinburgh (1999-2003), and Cambridge (1990-2006), as well as Scottish national pregnancy discharge data (2004-2007)) to evaluate different approaches to adjustment for optimism. We found that sample splitting, cross-validation without replication, and leave-1-out cross-validation produced optimism-adjusted estimates of the C statistic that were biased and/or associated with greater absolute error than other available methods. Cross-validation with replication, bootstrapping, and a new method (leave-pair-out cross-validation) all generated unbiased optimism-adjusted estimates of the C statistic and had similar absolute errors in the clinical data set. Larger simulation studies confirmed that all 3 methods performed similarly with 10 or more events per variable, or when the C statistic was 0.9 or greater. However, with lower events per variable or lower C statistics, bootstrapping tended to be optimistic but with lower absolute and mean squared errors than both methods of cross-validation.},

Features tested as inputs were: average signal, signal standard deviation, energy, contrast, correlation, homogeneity and entropy (all defined on T2WI); and average ADC. A forward selection scheme was used on the remaining 20{\%} of training set supervoxels to identify important inputs. The trained model was tested on a different set of ten patients, half with TZ tumors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In training cases, the software tiled the TZ with 4 × 4-voxel "supervoxels," 80{\%} of which were used to train the classifier. Each of 100 iterations selected T2WI energy and average ADC, which therefore were deemed the optimal model input. The two-feature model was applied blindly to the separate set of test patients, again without operator input of suspicious foci. The software correctly predicted presence or absence of TZ tumor in all test patients. Furthermore, locations of predicted tumors corresponded spatially with locations of biopsies that had confirmed their presence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Preliminary findings suggest that this tool has potential to accurately predict TZ tumor presence and location, without operator input.J.

Following radical prostatectomy, the cancer extent was delineated by a pathologist on ex vivo histology and mapped to MRI by nonlinear registration of histology and corresponding MRI slices. In all, 244 computer-extracted features were extracted from MRI, and principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to reduce the data dimensionality so that a generalizable classifier could be constructed.

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the interpatient variability of prostate peripheral zone (PZ) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and its effect on the assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The requirement for institutional review board approval was waived. Intra- and interpatient variation of PZ ADCs was determined by means of repeated measurements of normal ADCs at three magnetic resonance (MR) examinations in a retrospective cohort of 10 consecutive patients who had high prostate-specific antigen levels and negative findings at transrectal ultrasonographically-guided biopsy. In these patients, no signs of PZ cancer were found at all three MR imaging sessions. The effect of interpatient variation on the assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness was examined in a second retrospective cohort of 51 patients with PZ prostate cancer. Whole-mount step-section pathologic evaluation served as reference standard for placement of regions of interest on tumors and normal PZ. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to determine the significance of the interpatient variations in ADCs. Linear logistic regression was used to assess whether incorporating normal PZ ADCs improves the prediction of cancer aggressiveness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed that interpatient variability (1.2-2.0×10(-3) mm2/sec) was significantly larger than measurement variability (0.068×10(-3) mm2/sec±0.027 [standard deviation]) (P=.0058). Stand-alone tumor ADCs showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 for discriminating low-grade versus high-grade tumors. Incorporating normal PZ ADC significantly improved the AUC to 0.96 (P=.0401).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: PZ ADCs show significant interpatient variation, which has a substantial effect on the prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness. Correcting this effect results in a significant increase in diagnostic accuracy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential utility of a number of parameters obtained at T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of prostate cancer and assessment of cancer aggressiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant study, multiparametric MR images were acquired with an endorectal coil in 48 patients with prostate cancer (median age, 62.5 years; age range, 44-73 years) who subsequently underwent prostatectomy. A radiologist and a pathologist identified 104 regions of interest (ROIs) (61 cancer ROIs, 43 normal ROIs) based on correlation of histologic and MR findings. The 10th percentile and average apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, T2-weighted signal intensity histogram skewness, and Tofts K(trans) were analyzed, both individually and combined, via linear discriminant analysis, with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis with area under the curve (AUC) as figure of merit, to distinguish cancer foci from normal foci. Spearman rank-order correlation ($\rho$) was calculated between cancer foci Gleason score (GS) and image features. RESULTS: AUC (maximum likelihood estimate ± standard error) values in the differentiation of prostate cancer from normal foci of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, T2-weighted skewness, and K(trans) were 0.92 ± 0.03, 0.89 ± 0.03, 0.86 ± 0.04, and 0.69 ± 0.04, respectively. The combination of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, and T2-weighted skewness yielded an AUC value for the same task of 0.95 ± 0.02. GS correlated moderately with 10th percentile ADC ($\rho$ = -0.34, P = .008), average ADC ($\rho$ = -0.30, P = .02), and K(trans) ($\rho$ = 0.38, P = .004). CONCLUSION: The combination of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, and T2-weighted skewness with CAD is promising in the differentiation of prostate cancer from normal tissue. ADC image features and K(trans) moderately correlate with GS.},

abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. Incidence data were collected by the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 1,665,540 new cancer cases and 585,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2014. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2006-2010), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6{\%} per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8{\%} per year in men and by 1.4{\%} per year in women. The combined cancer death rate (deaths per 100,000 population) has been continuously declining for 2 decades, from a peak of 215.1 in 1991 to 171.8 in 2010. This 20{\%} decline translates to the avoidance of approximately 1,340,400 cancer deaths (952,700 among men and 387,700 among women) during this time period. The magnitude of the decline in cancer death rates from 1991 to 2010 varies substantially by age, race, and sex, ranging from no decline among white women aged 80 years and older to a 55{\%} decline among black men aged 40 years to 49 years. Notably, black men experienced the largest drop within every 10-year age group. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.},

abstract = {MRI has shown to have great potential in prostate cancer localization and grading, but interpreting those exams requires expertise that is not widely available. Therefore, CAD applications are being developed to aid radiologists in detecting prostate cancer. Existing CAD applications focus on the prostate as a whole. However, in clinical practice transition zone cancer and peripheral zone cancer are considered to have different appearances. In this paper we present zone-specific CAD, in addition to an atlas based segmentation technique which includes zonal segmentation. Our CAD system consists of a detection and a classification stage. Prior to the detection stage the prostate is segmented into two zones. After segmentation features are extracted. Subsequently a likelihood map is generated on which local maxima detection is performed. For each local maximum a region is segmented. In the classification stage additional shape features are calculated, after which the regions are classified. Validation was performed on 288 data sets with MR-guided biopsy results as ground truth. Freeresponse Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) analysis was used for statistical evaluation. The difference between whole-prostate and zone-specific CAD was assessed using the difference between the FROCs. Our results show that evaluating the two zones separately results in an increase in performance compared to whole-prostate CAD. The FROC curves at.1, 1 and 3 false positives have a sensitivity of 0.0, 0.55 and 0.72 for whole-prostate and 0.08, 0.57 and 0.80 for zone-specific CAD. The FROC curve of the zone-specific CAD also showed significantly better performance overall (p {\textless} 0.05). {\textcopyright} 2012 SPIE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cross-validation (CV) is an effective method for estimating the prediction error of a classifier. Some recent articles have proposed methods for optimizing classifiers by choosing classifier parameter values that minimize the CV error estimate. We have evaluated the validity of using the CV error estimate of the optimized classifier as an estimate of the true error expected on independent data. RESULTS We used CV to optimize the classification parameters for two kinds of classifiers; Shrunken Centroids and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random training datasets were created, with no difference in the distribution of the features between the two classes. Using these "null" datasets, we selected classifier parameter values that minimized the CV error estimate. 10-fold CV was used for Shrunken Centroids while Leave-One-Out-CV (LOOCV) was used for the SVM. Independent test data was created to estimate the true error. With "null" and "non null" (with differential expression between the classes) data, we also tested a nested CV procedure, where an inner CV loop is used to perform the tuning of the parameters while an outer CV is used to compute an estimate of the error. The CV error estimate for the classifier with the optimal parameters was found to be a substantially biased estimate of the true error that the classifier would incur on independent data. Even though there is no real difference between the two classes for the "null" datasets, the CV error estimate for the Shrunken Centroid with the optimal parameters was less than 30{\%} on 18.5{\%} of simulated training data-sets. For SVM with optimal parameters the estimated error rate was less than 30{\%} on 38{\%} of "null" data-sets. Performance of the optimized classifiers on the independent test set was no better than chance. The nested CV procedure reduces the bias considerably and gives an estimate of the error that is very close to that obtained on the independent testing set for both Shrunken Centroids and SVM classifiers for "null" and "non-null" data distributions. CONCLUSION We show that using CV to compute an error estimate for a classifier that has itself been tuned using CV gives a significantly biased estimate of the true error. Proper use of CV for estimating true error of a classifier developed using a well defined algorithm requires that all steps of the algorithm, including classifier parameter tuning, be repeated in each CV loop. A nested CV procedure provides an almost unbiased estimate of the true error.},

abstract = {Image intensity standardization is a post-acquisition processing operation designed for correcting acquisition-to-acquisition signal intensity variations (non-standardness) inherent in Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. While existing standardization methods based on histogram landmarks have been shown to produce a significant gain in the similarity of resulting image intensities, their weakness is that in some instances the same histogram-based landmark may represent one tissue, while in other cases it may represent different tissues. This is often true for diseased or abnormal patient studies in which significant changes in image intensity characteristics may occur. In an attempt to overcome this problem, in this paper, we present two new intensity standardization methods based on two scale concepts developed in Madabhushi et al. [Computer Vision Image Understanding 101, 100-121 (2006)] for image processing applications. These scale concepts are utilized in this paper to accurately determine principal tissue regions within MR images. Landmarks derived from these regions are used to perform intensity standardization. The new methods were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated on a total of 67 clinical three dimensional (3D) MR images corresponding to four different protocols and to normal, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and brain tumor patient studies. The new scale-based methods were found to be better than the existing methods, with a significant improvement observed for severely diseased and abnormal patient studies.},

abstract = {Hitherto communication theory was based on two alternative methods of signal analysis. One is the description of the signal as a function of time; the other is Fourier analysis. Both are idealizations, as the first method operates with sharply defined instants of time, the second with infinite wave-trains of rigorously defined frequencies. But our everyday experiences{\^{A}}especially our auditory sensations{\^{A}}insist on a description in terms of both time and frequency. In the present paper this point of view is developed in quantitative language. Signals are represented in two dimensions, with time and frequency as co-ordinates. Such two-dimensional representations can be called {\^{A}}information diagrams,{\^{A}} as areas in them are proportional to the number of independent data which they can convey. This is a consequence of the fact that the frequency of a signal which is not of infinite duration can be defined only with a certain inaccuracy, which is inversely proportional to the duration, and vice versa. This {\^{A}}uncertainty relation{\^{A}} suggests a new method of description, intermediate between the two extremes of time analysis and spectral analysis. There are certain {\^{A}}elementary signals{\^{A}} which occupy the smallest possible area in the information diagram. They are harmonic oscillations modulated by a {\^{A}}probability pulse.{\^{A}} Each elementary signal can be considered as conveying exactly one datum, or one {\^{A}}quantum of information.{\^{A}} Any signal can be expanded in terms of these by a process which includes time analysis and Fourier analysis as extreme cases. These new methods of analysis, which involve some of the mathematical apparatus of quantum theory, are illustrated by application to some problems of transmission theory, such as direct generation of single sidebands, signals transmitted in minimum time through limited frequency channels, frequency modulation and time-division multiplex telephony.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional spatial linear filters are constrained by general uncertainty relations that limit their attainable information resolution for orientation, spatial frequency, and two-dimensional (2D) spatial position. The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.},

abstract = {Reliable estimation of the classification performance of inferred predictive models is difficult when working with small data sets. Cross-validation is in this case a typical strategy for estimating the performance. However, many standard approaches to cross-validation suffer from extensive bias or variance when the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is used as the performance measure. This issue is explored through an extensive simulation study. Leave-pair-out cross-validation is proposed for conditional AUC-estimation, as it is almost unbiased, and its deviation variance is as low as that of the best alternative approaches. When using regularized least-squares based learners, efficient algorithms exist for calculating the leave-pair-out cross-validation estimate. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aim: To evaluate diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) as a marker for disease aggressiveness by comparing tumour apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) between patients with low- versus higher-risk localized prostate cancer. Method: Forty-four consecutive patients classified as low- [n = 26, stageT1/T2a, Gleason score ≤ 6, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) {\textless} 10 (group 1)] or intermediate/high- [n = 18, stage ≥ T2b and/or Gleason score ≥ 7, and/or PSA {\textgreater} 10 (group 2)] risk, who subsequently were monitored with active surveillance or started neoadjuvant hormone and radiotherapy, respectively, underwent endorectal MRI. T2-weighted (T2W) and DW images (5 b values, 0-800 s/mm2) were acquired and isotropic ADC maps generated. Regions of interest (ROIs) on T2W axial images [around whole prostate, central gland (CG), and tumour] were transferred to ADC maps. Tumour, CG, and peripheral zone (PZ = whole prostate minus CG and tumour) ADCs (fast component from b = 0-100 s/mm2, slow component from b = 100-800 s/mm2) were compared. Results: T2W-defined tumour volume medians, and quartiles were 1.2 cm3, 0.7 and 3.3 cm3 (group 1); and 6 cm3, 1.3 and 16.5 cm3 (group 2). There were significant differences in both ADCfast (1778 ± 264 × 10-6 versus 1583 ± 283 × 10-6 mm2/s, p = 0.03) and ADCslow (1379 ± 321 × 10-6 versus 1196 ± 158 × 10-6 mm2/s, p = 0.001) between groups. Tumour volume (p = 0.002) and ADCslow (p = 0.005) were significant differentiators of risk group. Conclusion: Significant differences in tumour ADCs exist between patients with low-risk, and those with higher-risk localized prostate cancer. DW-MRI merits further study with respect to clinical outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal College of Radiologists.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify and evaluate textural quantitative imaging signatures (QISes) for tumors occurring within the central gland (CG) and peripheral zone (PZ) of the prostate, respectively, as seen on in vivo 3 Tesla (T) endorectal T2-weighted (T2w) MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used 22 preoperative prostate MRI data sets (16 PZ, 6 CG) acquired from men with confirmed prostate cancer (CaP) and scheduled for radical prostatectomy (RP). The prostate region-of-interest (ROI) was automatically delineated on T2w MRI, following which it was corrected for intensity-based acquisition artifacts. An expert pathologist manually delineated the dominant tumor regions on ex vivo sectioned and stained RP specimens as well as identified each of the studies as either a CG or PZ CaP. A nonlinear registration scheme was used to spatially align and then map CaP extent from the ex vivo RP sections onto the corresponding MRI slices. A total of 110 texture features were then extracted on a per-voxel basis from all T2w MRI data sets. An information theoretic feature selection procedure was then applied to identify QISes comprising T2w MRI textural features specific to CG and PZ CaP, respectively. The QISes for CG and PZ CaP were evaluated by means of Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) on a per-voxel basis against the ground truth for CaP on T2w MRI, mapped from corresponding histology. RESULTS: The QDA classifier yielded an area under the Receiver Operating characteristic curve of 0.86 for the CG CaP studies, and 0.73 for the PZ CaP studies over 25 runs of randomized three-fold cross-validation. By comparison, the accuracy of the QDA classifier was significantly lower when (a) using all 110 texture features (with no feature selection applied), as well as (b) a randomly selected combination of texture features. CONCLUSION: CG and PZ prostate cancers have significantly differing textural quantitative imaging signatures on T2w endorectal in vivo MRI.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate Haralick texture analysis of prostate MRI for cancer detection and differentiating Gleason scores (GS). METHODS: One hundred and forty-seven patients underwent T2- weighted (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted prostate MRI. Cancers {\textgreater}/=0.5 ml and non-cancerous peripheral (PZ) and transition (TZ) zone tissue were identified on T2WI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, using whole-mount pathology as reference. Texture features (Energy, Entropy, Correlation, Homogeneity, Inertia) were extracted and analysed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: PZ cancers (n = 143) showed higher Entropy and Inertia and lower Energy, Correlation and Homogeneity compared to non-cancerous tissue on T2WI and ADC maps (p-values: {\textless}.0001-0.008). In TZ cancers (n = 43) we observed significant differences for all five texture features on the ADC map (all p-values: {\textless}.0001) and for Correlation (p = 0.041) and Inertia (p = 0.001) on T2WI. On ADC maps, GS was associated with higher Entropy (GS 6 vs. 7: p = 0.0225; 6 vs. {\textgreater}7: p = 0.0069) and lower Energy (GS 6 vs. 7: p = 0.0116, 6 vs. {\textgreater}7: p = 0.0039). ADC map Energy (p = 0.0102) and Entropy (p = 0.0019) were significantly different in GS {\textless}/=3 + 4 versus {\textgreater}/=4 + 3 cancers; ADC map Entropy remained significant after controlling for the median ADC (p = 0.0291). CONCLUSION: Several Haralick-based texture features appear useful for prostate cancer detection and GS assessment. KEY POINTS: * Several Haralick texture features may differentiate non-cancerous and cancerous prostate tissue. * Tumour Energy and Entropy on ADC maps correlate with Gleason score. * T2w-image-derived texture features are not associated with the Gleason score.},

abstract = {Prostate segmentation is a challenging task, and the challenges significantly differ from one imaging modality to another. Low contrast, speckle, micro-calcifications and imaging artifacts like shadow poses serious challenges to accurate prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images. However in magnetic resonance (MR) images, superior soft tissue contrast highlights large variability in shape, size and texture information inside the prostate. In contrast poor soft tissue contrast between prostate and surrounding tissues in computed tomography (CT) images pose a challenge in accurate prostate segmentation. This article reviews the methods developed for prostate gland segmentation TRUS, MR and CT images, the three primary imaging modalities that aids prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this work is to study the key similarities and differences among the different methods, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in order to assist in the choice of an appropriate segmentation methodology. We define a new taxonomy for prostate segmentation strategies that allows first to group the algorithms and then to point out the main advantages and drawbacks of each strategy. We provide a comprehensive description of the existing methods in all TRUS, MR and CT modalities, highlighting their key-points and features. Finally, a discussion on choosing the most appropriate segmentation strategy for a given imaging modality is provided. A quantitative comparison of the results as reported in literature is also presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

However, in recent years a wealth of new datasets has become available. Therefore, we take a more data-centric approach and propose a unified framework for studying climate, with an aim toward characterizing observed phenomena as well as discovering new knowledge in climate science. Specifically, we posit that complex networks are well suited for both descriptive analysis and predictive modeling tasks. We show that the structural properties of 'climate networks' have useful interpretation within the domain. Further, we extract clusters from these networks and demonstrate their predictive power as climate indices. Our experimental results establish that the network clusters are statistically significantly better predictors than clusters derived using a more traditional clustering approach. Using complex networks as data representation thus enables the unique opportunity for descriptive and predictive modeling to inform each other. 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Recently, high resolution 3 Tesla (T) Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of the prostate has emerged as a promising modality for detecting prostate cancer (CaP). Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes for DCE-MRI data have thus far been primarily developed for breast cancer and typically involve model fitting of dynamic intensity changes as a function of contrast agent uptake by the lesion. Comparatively there is relatively little work in developing CAD schemes for prostate DCE-MRI. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised detection scheme for CaP from 3 T DCE-MRI which comprises 3 distinct steps. First, a multi-attribute active shape model is used to automatically segment the prostate boundary from 3 T in vivo MR imagery. A robust multimodal registration scheme is then used to non-linearly align corresponding whole mount histological and DCE-MRI sections from prostatectomy specimens to determine the spatial extent of CaP. Non-linear dimensionality reduction schemes such as locally linear embedding (LLE) have been previously shown to be useful in projecting such high dimensional biomedical data into a lower dimensional subspace while preserving the non-linear geometry of the data manifold. DCE-MRI data is embedded via LLE and then classified via unsupervised consensus clustering to identify distinct classes. Quantitative evaluation on 21 histology-MRI slice pairs against registered CaP ground truth estimates yielded a maximum CaP detection accuracy of 77.20{\%} while the popular three time point (3TP) scheme yielded an accuracy of 67.37{\%}.},

abstract = {The roles of physicists in medical imaging have expanded over the years, from the study of imaging systems (sources and detectors) and dose to the assessment of image quality and perception, the development of image processing techniques, and the development of image analysis methods to assist in detection and diagnosis. The latter is a natural extension of medical physicists' goals in developing imaging techniques to help physicians acquire diagnostic information and improve clinical decisions. Studies indicate that radiologists do not detect all abnormalities on images that are visible on retrospective review, and they do not always correctly characterize abnormalities that are found. Since the 1950s, the potential use of computers had been considered for analysis of radiographic abnormalities. In the mid-1980s, however, medical physicists and radiologists began major research efforts for computer-aided detection or computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), that is, using the computer output as an aid to radiologists-as opposed to a completely automatic computer interpretation-focusing initially on methods for the detection of lesions on chest radiographs and mammograms. Since then, extensive investigations of computerized image analysis for detection or diagnosis of abnormalities in a variety of 2D and 3D medical images have been conducted. The growth of CAD over the past 20 years has been tremendous-from the early days of time-consuming film digitization and CPU-intensive computations on a limited number of cases to its current status in which developed CAD approaches are evaluated rigorously on large clinically relevant databases. CAD research by medical physicists includes many aspects-collecting relevant normal and pathological cases; developing computer algorithms appropriate for the medical interpretation task including those for segmentation, feature extraction, and classifier design; developing methodology for assessing CAD performance; validating the algorithms using appropriate cases to measure performance and robustness; conducting observer studies with which to evaluate radiologists in the diagnostic task without and with the use of the computer aid; and ultimately assessing performance with a clinical trial. Medical physicists also have an important role in quantitative imaging, by validating the quantitative integrity of scanners and developing imaging techniques, and image analysis tools that extract quantitative data in a more accurate and automated fashion. As imaging systems become more complex and the need for better quantitative information from images grows, the future includes the combined research efforts from physicists working in CAD with those working on quantitative imaging systems to readily yield information on morphology, function, molecular structure, and more-from animal imaging research to clinical patient care. A historical review of CAD and a discussion of challenges for the future are presented here, along with the extension to quantitative image analysis.},

abstract = {Purpose: Reports of biochemical recurrence after prostate cancer primary therapy show differences between Gleason 4 + 3 and 3 + 4 tumors. To our knowledge these findings have not been explored for prostate cancer specific mortality. In this population based cohort we determined prostate cancer outcomes at different Gleason scores, particularly the different Gleason 7 patterns. Materials and Methods: Men 40 to 64 years old who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1993 and 1996 in King County, Washington comprised the cohort. Recurrence/progression was determined by followup survey and medical record review. Mortality and cause of death were obtained from the Seattle-Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry. HRs for outcomes were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: In 753 men with prostate cancer 65 prostate cancer specific deaths occurred during a median followup of 13.2 years. The 10-year prostate cancer specific survival rate for Gleason 6 or less, 3 + 4, 4 + 3 and 8-10 disease was 98.4{\%}, 92.1{\%}, 76.5{\%} and 69.9{\%}, respectively. Compared to patients with Gleason 3 + 4 disease those with Gleason 4 + 3 tumors were at increased risk for prostate cancer specific mortality in the unadjusted and multivariate models (HR 2.80, 95{\%} CI 1.26-6.18 and HR 2.12, 95{\%} CI 0.87-5.17, respectively). In men undergoing curative therapy with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy there was an increased risk of recurrence/progression (HR 2.10, 95{\%} CI 1.08-4.08) and prostate cancer specific mortality (HR 3.17, 95{\%} CI 1.04-9.67) in those with Gleason 4 + 3 vs 3 + 4 tumors in the multivariate models. No difference in prostate cancer specific mortality was seen between Gleason 4 + 3 and 8-10 tumors. Conclusions: Gleason 7 prostate cancer shows heterogeneous behavior with Gleason 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 tumors conferring different prostate cancer specific mortality. These data provide important information for counseling patients with Gleason 7 prostate cancer on the natural history of the disease and may inform treatment decisions. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Urological Association.},

abstract = {There are many excellent toolkits which provide support for developing machine learning software in Python, R, Matlab, and similar environments. Dlib-ml is an open source library, targeted at both engineers and research scientists, which aims to provide a similarly rich environment for developing machine learning software in the C++ language. Towards this end, dlib-ml contains an extensible linear algebra toolkit with built in BLAS support. It also houses implementations of algorithms for performing inference in Bayesian networks and kernel-based methods for classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, and feature ranking. To enable easy use of these tools, the entire library has been developed with contract programming, which provides complete and precise documentation as well as powerful debugging tools.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted MRI has the potential to provide important new insights into physiological and microstructural properties of the body. The Intra-Voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) model relates the observed DW-MRI signal decay to parameters that reflect blood flow in the capillaries (D*), capillaries volume fraction (f), and diffusivity (D). However, the commonly used, independent voxel-wise fitting of the IVIM model leads to imprecise parameter estimates, which has hampered their practical usage.In this work, we improve the precision of estimates by introducing a spatially-constrained Incoherent Motion (IM) model of DW-MRI signal decay. We also introduce an efficient iterative " fusion bootstrap moves" (FBM) solver that enables precise parameter estimates with this new IM model. This solver updates parameter estimates by applying a binary graph-cut solver to fuse the current estimate of parameter values with a new proposal of the parameter values into a new estimate of parameter values that better fits the observed DW-MRI data. The proposals of parameter values are sampled from the independent voxel-wise distributions of the parameter values with a model-based bootstrap resampling of the residuals.We assessed both the improvement in the precision of the incoherent motion parameter estimates and the characterization of heterogeneous tumor environments by analyzing simulated and in vivo abdominal DW-MRI data of 30 patients, and in vivo DW-MRI data of three patients with musculoskeletal lesions. We found our IM-FBM reduces the relative root mean square error of the D* parameter estimates by 80{\%}, and of the f and D parameter estimates by 50{\%} compared to the IVIM model with the simulated data. Similarly, we observed that our IM-FBM method significantly reduces the coefficient of variation of parameter estimates of the D* parameter by 43{\%}, the f parameter by 37{\%}, and the D parameter by 17{\%} compared to the IVIM model (paired Student's t-test, p{\textless}0.0001). In addition, we found our IM-FBM method improved the characterization of heterogeneous musculoskeletal lesions by means of increased contrast-to-noise ratio of 19.3{\%}.The IM model and FBM solver combined, provide more precise estimate of the physiological model parameter values that describing the DW-MRI signal decay and a better mechanism for characterizing heterogeneous lesions than does the independent voxel-wise IVIM model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {These lectures on selected chapters of communication theory are complementary to the well-known works of American authors on the statistical theory of communication, which is not discussed here at any length. About one-third of the lectures have as their subject the theory of signal analysis or representation, which precedes the statistical theory, both logically and historically. The mathematical theory is followed by a physical theory of signals, in which the fundamental limitations of signal transmission and recognition are discussed in the light of classical and of quantum physics. It is shown that the viewpoints of communication theory represent a useful approach to modern physics, of appreciable heuristic power, showing up the insufficiencies of the classical theory. The final part of the lectures is a report on the present state of speech analysis and speech compression, with suggestions for further research.},
